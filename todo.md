# Tariff Rate Tracker — TODO

## Active priorities (updated 2026-06-10: rev_10 merged + first `release/` publish; build-unification Phase 0 done)

1. **Validate the re-dated rebuild.** Revision re-dating LANDED (commit 6559c2f): `policy_effective_date` populated for 35 revisions from the change-record audit (`scripts/audit_revision_dates.R`); 2026_rev_8 dropped from the series; the `tpc_policy_revision=rev_7` override removed. The full rebuild with corrected dates has since completed (the 2026-06-09 `release/` publish is built from it, through 2026_rev_10). Acceptance checks still outstanding: (a) ~~TPC policy-aligned table~~ DIRECTION CHANGE 2026-06-10: the manual TPC alignment table is retired — external validation moves to the **external-tracker comparison database** (see its section below + `docs/external_tracker_comparison.md`); until that lands, the spot-check is the same fact (Apr 17 should move from −9.71pp to low single digits under the re-dating) verified against the TPC flow file directly; (b) `compare_etrs.R`; (c) re-run `src/revision_changelog.R` so the changelog summary table picks up corrected dates; (d) hand snapshots to tariff-etr-eval — the eval's month-weighting (`usmca_h2avg` day-weighted to months) shifts materially in Mar–May and Sep–Dec 2025.
2. **Findings from the three-model decomposition (2026-06-06, `output/model_compare/`).** (a) **8471 in the annex era:** the auto-parts applicability exclusion removed 8471 from `heading_program_products`, so from 2026_rev_5 the step-5c metals-annex override now applies — and bare `8471` is on annex_1b (aluminum) per the proclamation's own Note 16(c) list (`s232_annex_products.csv`). Production therefore charges computers 25% full-value annex_1b from Apr 6, 2026 (vs 23.76% auto-parts before the fix — levels barely moved, +0.04pp ETR). This is the literal statutory reading of the new regime and there is no post-April Census evidence yet (eval window ends Mar 2026); decide when April+ collections land — the dormant 9903.82.01 zero-metal-content carve-out or an annex-level applicability share are the natural knobs. (b) **Fix-1 universe lines are invisible to all weighted ETRs:** the GTAP weights file uses 2024-vintage HTS10 codes, so the padded `…00` 8-digit-leaf codes (Swiss watches, ch98) never match the weights join — in the three-model comparison AND in the production weighted-output path (formerly `08_weighted_etr.R`, now the output/daily path). Daily *weighted* series understate their contribution; the eval's Census-side panel is unaffected. Fix: HS8-level fallback in the weights join or a concordance pass on the weights file.
3. **Retro-window follow-ups from the re-dating.** Three legally-retroactive regimes are not modeled because their HTS text arrived weeks after legal effect: EU framework exemptions retro to Sep 1 2025 (text Sep 25, rev_24); Korea floor retro to Nov 14 2025 (text Dec 5, rev_32); rev_4's 232-derivative items (Mar 12) briefly absent Mar 7–13 (rev_4 dated at the Mar-7 USMCA carve-out; stated-date gate releases them at rev_5 Mar 14). Pattern for fixing any of these if they matter in the eval: date-bounded config override like `swiss_framework`. Also: extend the release-currency gate to cross-check NEW revisions' dates against their change records at build time so dates can't drift again.
4. ~~**Sync published rev_5 artifacts with current code**~~ **DONE 2026-06-08** — `tests/test_rate_calculation.R` now passes 92/0/0 (was 3 failures in Test 12 "Annex-era country surcharges (rev_5)" against stale artifacts); the landed Russia fix is reflected in saved outputs. All four CI smoke suites green. No further action needed here.
5. **Finish the biggest post-annex modeling gaps**: Russia clause (8) full smelter/cast origin logic, UK 95% qualifying-content blending, Annex IV exception buckets, and product-condition exemptions like 9903.81.92 are still approximated or unmodeled. (9903.82.01 zero-metal-content is now scaffolded but dormant — calibration is its own line item below.)
6. **Then clear secondary rebuild/calibration debt**: rerun the OOM-failed post-build alternatives, calibrate semi/annex/zmc assumptions, and tackle the remaining low-priority performance and cleanup items.

## Specific/compound-duty EXPOSURE flags (re-scoped 2026-06-10; was "AVE gap")

**SCOPE DECISION (user, 2026-06-10): the tracker will NOT incorporate specific
or compound duties — no AVE conversion, no salvaging the ad-valorem component.**
The tracker models statutory ad-valorem rates; non-ad-valorem MFN duties are a
documented modeling boundary. What the tracker SHOULD do is **identify the
exposed product×country cells** so downstream consumers (tariff-etr-adj η
calibration, the eval, quality reports) can see exactly which lines carry a
duty the tracker models as 0%. Any AVE conversion / unit-value work, if ever
wanted, lives on the eval side.

Background (unchanged diagnosis): `parse_rate()` (`src/helpers.R:71-99`)
returns NA for any non-`%` rate; `04_parse_products.R` only recovers NA via
parent-inheritance for EMPTY strings, so non-empty specific/compound lines
(e.g. `1901.10.16.00` = `$1.035/kg + 14.9%`) end at `base_rate = 0`. Chapter
exposure (rev_5 leaf lines): HS04 47%, HS17 38%, HS21 31%, HS22 27%, HS20 23%,
HS19 18% vs ~0% in machinery. This drives the food-complex negative η (HS19
−0.54, HS21 −0.49) — magnitude tracks value-weighted exposure. TRQ structure
(1901.90 dairy) is a sub-case. Re-frames
`docs/analysis/eta_compliance_gap_drivers.md` reason #3 (dominant, not
residual, for HS17/19/21).

**Good news (scoped 2026-06-10): the flag is half-built already.**
`parse_products()` retains `base_rate_raw` (the raw duty string) and a
`has_complex_rate` flag (`!is_simple_rate(general) && general != ''`) in the
products tibble, cached per revision in `data/timeseries/products_<rev>.rds` —
so classification needs NO archive re-parsing. Neither column currently flows
past the parse.

**DISCOVERY (2026-06-10, plan pass): latent stale-sibling inheritance bug in
`rate_stack`.** `parse_products()` (`src/04_parse_products.R:62`) only updates
the inheritance stack when a line's rate is parseable/simple/"Free" — a
COMPOUND-rated parent never updates the stack. So a statistical suffix under a
compound legal line (e.g. children of `1901.10.16`, "$1.035/kg + 14.9%") walks
the stack and can inherit an EARLIER SIBLING legal line's ad-valorem rate at
the same indent — a wrong, nonzero base_rate, distinct from the known NA→0
fill. Unquantified. Design consequence: the new type inheritance must NOT
reuse `rate_stack`; build a parallel `type_stack` updated on EVERY non-empty
`general` line (including compound), which gives correct type inheritance with
zero change to rate numbers. Fixing the rate-side bug moves numbers → separate
parity-gated change (see new item below).

**Hard constraint for the implementation: zero rate-number changes.**
Acceptance = single-revision rebuild (`scripts/rebuild_one_revision.R`, rev_5,
unweighted): all rate columns byte-identical to the current snapshot, AND
chapter exposure shares reproduce the diagnosis (HS04 ~47%, HS17 ~38%, HS21
~31%, HS19 ~18%, machinery ~0%).

- [ ] **Add `base_rate_type` to the panel** (values: `ad_valorem` / `free` /
  `specific_or_compound` / `other`), derived in `04_parse_products.R` via a
  new pure `classify_rate_type()` in `helpers.R` (next to `parse_rate()`) +
  the parallel `type_stack` above for suffix inheritance (≈59% of HTS10s are
  empty-string suffixes; a suffix under a compound parent IS exposed —
  labeling suffixes "empty" would miss most of the exposure). Eyeball
  whatever lands in `other` (expected ~empty) — verify, don't rationalize.
  Carry into the rates grid at TWO verified insertion points in
  `06_calculate_rates.R`: the base-rate join in `calculate_rates_fast()`
  (~line 192) and `ensure_dense_grid()` (~line 907: add to the products
  select AND to `EXPLICIT_SET_COLUMNS` — its column-accounting gate fails
  loud if forgotten). The other base_rate re-joins (~1310, ~1925; floor/MFN
  recomputes) don't need it. `enforce_rate_schema()` preserves extra columns
  (same lifecycle precedent as `rate_s301fl`), so schema-non-breaking.
  CACHE GUARD: existing `products_<rev>.rds` caches lack the column — fail
  loud (or re-parse) when a cached products rds has no `base_rate_type`
  (same hazard class as the stale rev_5 snapshot gotcha); regenerate locally
  via `scripts/refresh_product_caches.R`. Footprint: character col ≈ 8B/row
  → ~1.6GB at the 195M-row full-scale assemble; fine at 192GB. NOTE for the
  parity harness: snapshots gain a column — numeric-tolerance parity on rate
  columns should be unaffected, but confirm the `src/parity.R` comparator
  ignores new metadata columns before the next parity run.
- [ ] **Quality-report surface**: unweighted `pct_pairs_specific_or_compound`
  in `compute_revision_quality()` (`src/quality_report.R:72` →
  `output/quality/revision_quality.csv`, always available), plus a
  per-revision side table `output/quality/specific_duty_exposure_<rev>.csv`
  (hts10, base_rate_raw, base_rate_type, description) built from the cached
  products rds. VALUE-WEIGHTED exposure share goes in `src/diagnostics.R`
  alongside `report_universe_completeness()` (reuse its Census-weights loader
  + graceful no-weights skip; numbers come from the next cluster build).
- [ ] **Flow the flag to consumers**: add `base_rate_type` to the
  `statutory_rates.csv.gz` select in `export_statutory_rates()`
  (`src/generate_etrs_config.R`) — ETRs/tariff-etr-adj read the CSV directly,
  extra column non-breaking — so they can mask or specially treat exposed
  cells in η calibration; document the scope decision ("ad-valorem only;
  exposed cells flagged, not converted") in `docs/assumptions.md`.
- [ ] **Tests**: `classify_rate_type()` units (`Free`, `6.8%`,
  `$1.035/kg + 14.9%`, `2.4¢/kg`, empty); fixture — compound parent → suffix
  inherits `specific_or_compound`, and a simple sibling BEFORE a compound
  parent does not leak its type; integration — snapshot carries the column,
  constant across countries within hts10, `1901.10.16.00` flags as exposed.
- [ ] **Quantify the stale-sibling rate inheritance bug (then decide fix).**
  Byproduct diagnostic of the type_stack work: count suffixes whose
  type-source line ≠ rate-source line, per revision, with value weights where
  available. The fix (update `rate_stack` on compound parents too, storing NA
  so children fall to NA→0 instead of a sibling's rate) MOVES NUMBERS —
  parity-gated, do NOT bundle with the flag change. Log findings in
  `tariff_tracker_investigated_issues` memory + here.

## Build unification plan (2026-06-09) — one build, three destinations, two backends

Today the compute backend dictates the destination: the serial entrypoint
(`00_build_timeseries.R --full`) writes only repo-local (+ `release/` via
`--publish-git`); the array flow (`submit_build_array.sh --config`) writes only
the shared model_data vintage ("repo never written"). Getting all destinations
means building twice. In-process cross-revision parallelism is a stub
(`parallel_lapply_revisions` always serial); only `--parallel` alternatives are
real. `submit_build.sh`/`submit_build_core.sh` were stale untracked wrappers
passing `--publish-internal`, a flag the entrypoint silently ignores (removed
from the CLI but never errored). Target end state: **one build product, three
publishers (repo mirror / vintage / release-git), two compute backends (array =
default, serial = parity baseline), one config, one verification gate.**

- [x] **Phase 0 — hygiene. DONE 2026-06-10** (commits `711223b`, `9613097`):
  stale untracked wrappers deleted; `scripts/README.md` declares blessed entry
  points; jar335-hardcoded repo paths parameterized in `submit_build_array.sh` /
  `build_array_task.sh` / `submit_build_gather.sh` / `submit_build_full.sh`;
  `00_build_timeseries.R` errors on unrecognized CLI flags; `publish_git`
  hardened (validate-then-delete, fail loud on zero/partial publish).
- [ ] **Phase 1 — destinations as config:** `destinations:` block in the build
  config (`repo:` mirror, `vintage:` + `update_latest:`, `release_git:`); three
  thin publishers reading one canonical build tree (publish_vintage exists;
  publish_git generalized to a source root; repo-mirror new). After this,
  verify-then-publish is ONE build.
- [ ] **Phase 2 — shared verification gate:** lift the verify steps (test suite +
  Russia/rev_10 sanity + NA-interval check) out of `submit_build_verify.sh` into
  `scripts/verify_build.R --output-root <dir>`; `verify: true` in config; array
  finalize requires it to pass before repointing `latest`.
- [ ] **Phase 3 — parallel by default:** array = default backend for real work;
  serial = golden parity baseline (keep; that's its job). Do NOT finish the
  in-process Phase-3 revision-parallel stub (array supersedes it). Fold the
  rebuild-alternatives into the array config as post-gather work units so they
  stop being a separate manual job.
- [ ] **Phase 4 — alternatives unification (planned 2026-06-10):** see next
  section.

## External-tracker comparison database (2026-06-10) — replaces the manual TPC alignment table

Full survey + verified endpoints + design: `docs/external_tracker_comparison.md`.
Decision: stop maintaining the hand-built TPC policy-aligned table; instead keep
a vintage-stamped comparison database of external tracker series under
`data/comparison/`, refreshed by fetchers, compared automatically against
`output/actual/daily/`.

- [ ] **Fetchers (`src/fetch_comparison_trackers.R`).** Browser UA mandatory
  (TPC 403s default agents). (a) Datawrapper resolver: `GET
  datawrapper.dwcdn.net/<id>/` → parse meta-refresh version → `<id>/<n>/dataset.csv`;
  version `n` = vintage key, ingest on bump. IDs: TPC `aO4iG` (daily 9-good),
  `MC81F` (weekly by tariff type), `e1Iok` (by-country snapshot); Tax Foundation
  `hn0bW` (daily-dated step series w/ event labels), `2dFbJ` (annual 1821–2026).
  (b) Treasury DTS API (daily customs deposits, `transaction_catg = "DHS -
  Customs Duties, Taxes, and Fees"`, no key). (c) PIIE ZIP HEAD-poll on
  `Last-Modified` (monthly collections ETR by country/BEC).
- [ ] **Comparison report (`src/compare_external_trackers.R`).** Tidy panel
  (date × source × series × value × vintage) + five automated overlays:
  headline daily ETR vs Tax Foundation steps + TPC type-sum; authority
  decomposition vs TPC `MC81F` (and CBP collections-by-action if scraped);
  by-country vs TPC `e1Iok` on vintage dates; 9-good daily spot-check vs
  `aO4iG`; statutory-vs-collections wedge vs DTS/PIIE (ingestion only —
  η analysis stays in `tariff-etr-adj`).
- [ ] **One-time GTA/SGEPT flow-level cross-validation.** Their public xlsx
  (CC BY 4.0, ~235k country×HS8 flows with explicit stacking formulas) is the
  closest methodological sibling but is frozen at 2025-12-23
  (pre-IEEPA-strikedown) — validate a pre-strikedown date against it; revisit
  ingestion if they refresh the file (live model is behind their MCP server).
- [ ] **Retire the old path once overlays 1–3 exist:** the per-revision TPC
  match-rate step in the build and `07_validate_tpc.R`-based acceptance checks
  point at the comparison DB instead. The private flow-level file
  (`data/tpc/tariff_by_flow_day.csv`) stays for historical flow-level
  validation — public endpoints don't include it (bilateral channel with
  McClelland/Wong for refreshes).

## Alternatives unification plan (2026-06-10) — one registry, one flag, one runner

**LANDED 2026-06-10 (Steps 1–4).** Discovery that reshaped the plan: the
AuthoritySpec verb/operations API the original plan assumed (`scenario_ops.R`,
`TARIFF_SCENARIO_OPS`) was deliberately DELETED in `54cc662` (no production
caller; `docs/scenarios.md` was stale). The live mechanism is config overlays
only — so everything, including counterfactuals, is now an overlay.

What landed (see `docs/scenarios.md` for the model):
- **Registry**: `src/scenario_registry.R` (`list_scenarios()`,
  `resolve_alternatives_selector()`, `build_scenario_alt_specs()`); every
  non-baseline series is `config/scenarios/<name>/{meta.yaml, overlay.yaml}`
  with `kind: alternative|counterfactual|scenario|baseline`. The 7 rebuild
  alternatives migrated from pp_override closures to overlays (the USMCA
  loaders DO read the pp keys — verified); per-variant pp now comes from
  `load_policy_params(scenario = name)`, identical to a TARIFF_SCENARIO build.
- **Counterfactuals resurrected as overlays**: new `disabled_authorities:`
  config hook — `apply_authority_disables()` in `src/rate_schema.R`, called at
  step 7g of `calculate_rates_for_revision()` (pre-stacking, so totals/shares
  recompute consistently). Six scenarios authored with their exact legacy
  `config/scenarios.yaml` semantics (no_ieepa, no_ieepa_recip, no_301, no_232,
  no_s122, pre_2025 — pre_2025 keeps 232 + legacy 301 incl. their 2025-26
  expansions, as before). Absent in baseline ⇒ byte-identical no-op.
- **One flag, one runner**: `--alternatives <names|all|alternatives|counterfactuals>`
  on `00_build_timeseries.R`; `run_alternative_series()` resolves the selector
  against the registry and dispatches through `alt_runner()`. Legacy
  `--with-alternatives`/`--rebuild-alts` kept as working aliases (the blog
  pipeline passes them) with a nudge message; unknown names now fail loud.
  Outputs already unify at `output/scenarios/<name>/` via `scenario_dir()`.
- **Tests**: `tests/test_scenario_registry.R` (35 green locally): registry
  validation, selector expansion, closure-vs-overlay pp parity for all 7
  alternatives, `apply_authority_disables()` units, counterfactual round-trips,
  and the invariant that a counterfactual pp differs from baseline ONLY in
  `disabled_authorities`.

Remaining:
- [ ] **Step 5 — cluster parity + verification gate.** (a) Golden diff: run
  `--alternatives alternatives` on the cluster and confirm the migrated
  overlays reproduce the prior `--with-alternatives` outputs; then DELETE the
  deprecated `build_rebuild_alt_registry()` (09_daily_series.R) and the
  parity section of the test. (b) First-ever run of the six counterfactuals
  (`--alternatives counterfactuals`, fresh-process-per-variant fixes the
  2026-04-22 OOM class) — sanity invariants: `no_301` ETR ≤ baseline
  everywhere, `pre_2025` < baseline post-Jan-2025. (c) Fold sanity checks into
  `verify_build.R` (build-unification Phase 2) so a failed variant fails the
  build instead of message(). (d) ~~Wire `tests/test_scenario_registry.R` into
  CI~~ (DONE in a3b88d3 — ci.yml smoke job, green); still pending: add it to
  the submit_plank cluster harnesses.
- [ ] **Migrate `SCENARIO_SPECS` in `build_usmca_scenarios.R`** (the standalone
  USMCA scenario builder) onto the registry, or retire that script if
  `--alternatives` covers its use.
- [ ] **`publish_git`/`publish_vintage` read `meta.publish`** to decide which
  scenario outputs ship (today: publish behavior unchanged).

## §301 exclusion headings dropped silently — full §301 charged on excluded lines (found 2026-06-09)

- [x] **Phase 1 LANDED 2026-06-10: date-windowed full-line zeroing (flagged UPPER BOUND).** Exclusion headings parse to `rate = NA` ("the duty provided in the applicable subheading"), `calculate_rates_fast()` drops NA-rate pairs from the rate join, so the engine charged full §301 on China mid-exclusion (evidence: rev_9, 221/8,052 pairs dropped, 170 HTS10 lines, dominated by 9903.88.69 = note 20(vvv), e.g. `0304725000` frozen haddock at 25% in-window). What landed:
  - **Expiry machinery** (`src/rate_schema.R`): `extract_expiry_date_offset()` — "through [date]" inclusive, "on or before" inclusive, "before [date]" exclusive (normalized to LAST ACTIVE DAY, max across matches, fail-loud on unparseable); `parse_chapter99()` attaches `expiry_date_offset`; `filter_active_ch99()` expiry gate **drops NA-RATE rows only** — see the rate-bearing-expiry item below for why.
  - **Registry** `resources/s301_exclusion_headings.csv` (58 headings; regenerate via `scripts/build_s301_exclusion_headings.R`, idempotent, curator rows win): auto rows = NA-rate §301 headings with "covered by an exclusion granted by USTR" text; coverage 1.0 ONLY if the heading text carries a window (18: .50–.70 rounds), windowless → coverage 0 + NEEDS_REVIEW (32). **Validity windows are NOT in the CSV** — they're read per revision from each archive's own heading text, because USTR extends them (`9903.88.69` expiry moved 2025-05-31 → 2025-08-31 → 2025-11-29 → 2026-11-09 across revisions); CSV validity_start/_end are curator overrides only.
  - **DISCOVERY — 9903.88.21–.28 are NOT product exclusions:** US note 20(z)–(gg) makes them PERMANENT CONDITIONAL derived-rate carve-outs (apply only when the entry's rate derives from another subheading on a §301 list), windowless. Curator rows at coverage 0 — full-line zeroing them would overcorrect forever. Phase-2 calibration target.
  - **Calc hook** step 6a-excl (`src/06_calculate_rates.R`, after the §301 blanket + content-split blocks, before 6b §122 — upstream of the 6b2 `statutory_rate_301` save, so the statutory shadow and the ETRs export inherit the correction): scales `rate_301`/`rate_301_cs` by `(1 − coverage_share)` for products whose ch99_refs hit an in-window registered heading. Windows recomputed from descriptions in-hook (immune to ch99 caches predating the expiry column). Config-gated: `section_301_exclusions:` in policy_params.yaml (overlay `section_301_exclusions: ~` disables; configured-but-missing file fails loud).
  - **Timeline**: expiry mirror in the `discover_boundaries` Ch99 scan (`src/timeline.R`) — NA-rate expiries interior to a revision's interval mint `bnd_<expiry+1>` snapshots (the mid-2025 stated expiries of .69/.70 are exactly this case).
  - **Tests**: 13 new in `tests/test_rate_calculation.R` (expiry extractor units incl. real .68/.69 wording, expiry-gate semantics incl. last-active-day boundary + backwards-compat, registry safety invariants, rev_9 haddock snapshot check). Suite: 98 pass / 2 skip / 2 fail locally — the 2 fails are the KNOWN stale-local-snapshot class (rev_5 Russia + the new rev_9 haddock test against the pre-fix artifact; both green after artifact re-sync). Also fixed: `scripts/rebuild_one_revision.R` still used the pre-Plank-7 calculator signature.
  - Docs: `docs/assumptions.md` §17.
- [x] **Phase 1 VALIDATED 2026-06-10 (5/5 acceptance, hook-on vs hook-off on identical HEAD code, rev_9):** exactly 144 cells × 4 cols (`rate_301`, `statutory_rate_301`, `total_additional`, `total_rate`), China only, exactly the 144 products referencing 9903.88.69/.70, haddock `0304725000` 25%→0 (total 35%→10%), expired rounds (.66/.67/.68) inert. Validated snapshot promoted to local `data/timeseries/snapshot_2026_rev_9.rds`; suite 99/2/1 locally (1 = known stale-rev_5 Russia artifact). METHOD NOTE: diffing scratch vs the Jun-5 local published snapshot was an INVALID baseline (local artifacts predate `2724bb3` edge-case fixes — broad rate_232/s122/base_rate diffs, all pre-existing); hook-on-vs-hook-off isolates the change correctly.
- [ ] **Ship Phase 1**: next full cluster rebuild picks the fix up for `output/actual/` + `release/` (expected effect: tiny negative China ETR contribution from the 144 lines, Jun 15 2024 → Nov 9 2026 window).
- [ ] **NEW (found by the expiry scan): two RATE-BEARING headings carry stated expiries that the tracker ignores** — `9903.91.04` (Biden §301 tier, "through December 31, 2025") and `9903.88.09` (vestigial 2019 §301 transition line). `filter_active_ch99()` RETAINS them by design (dropping moves numbers) and prints a NOTE each build. 9903.91.04's expiry is potentially a real un-modeled 2026 change — review whether a successor heading (9903.91.05+ tier ladder) already carries the post-2025 rate via max-per-hts8, then decide whether to enable a rate-bearing expiry gate (parity-gated).
- [ ] **Phase 2 (calibration): replace coverage_share = 1.0 with IMDB-realized exclusion claim shares** — entries filed under 9903.88.69 etc. vs total entries on the same HTS10×month (same pattern as the Annex II 9903.01.32 claim-share channel); resolves partial-line coverage empirically (note 20(vvv) exclusions are product-description-scoped and usually cover a slice of an HTS10 line, so Phase 1 overshoots by construction). Also calibrate the .21–.28 conditional carve-outs (or confirm immaterial). RETRO CAVEAT: if a USTR extension was granted after a lapse retroactively, Phase 1 models the lapse as published — same class as the EU/Korea retro-window items.

## AD/CVD: strip from collected, defer the statutory layer (decided 2026-06-08)

- [ ] **Strip AD/CVD out of the collected side (`cal_dut_mo` / `customs_duties`) before calibrating η — do NOT build the statutory `rate_adcvd` layer for now.** Decision rationale + caveats in `docs/adcvd_layer_design.md` §"Decision (2026-06-08)". Policy review: the AD/CVD *regime* is structurally unchanged (Tariff Act of 1930 deposit-at-entry, additive to MFN, in collected data but not the HTS schedule), but two 2024 Commerce final rules (Mar 25 / Dec 16 2024) broadened countervailability (transnational/Belt-and-Road subsidies, PMS, labor/env/IP) and the 2025-26 case docket is heavy — so the *levels* move, which is exactly why a static HTS×country statutory layer would be perpetually stale and the collected-strip is preferred. Implementation is **`tariff-etr-adj`-side** (calibration), not the tracker. Caveats: (a) no published HTS/country-level AD/CVD collection breakdown — strip is aggregate/by-partner only (CBP assessed figures); (b) AD/CVD shares the HS84/85/90 residual with 232-derivative under-capture, which is tracker-side (`metal_share`) and separate; (c) do exactly one — keep the `rate_adcvd` scaffold dormant, never both.

## Extreme-eta review fixes (2026-06-04)

Source: `docs/tracker_review_extreme_etas.md` (eval-side Census-vs-statutory etas) + code/snapshot verification against the 2026-05-08 rebuild (all findings confirmed live, not stale). Ordered by dependency and money, not by the review doc's original ranking. Verification details in `tariff_tracker_investigated_issues.md` (memory) — two of the doc's proposed mechanisms were wrong; the items below reflect the corrected root causes.

- [x] **1. Keep 8-digit leaf HTS lines (universe gap, 473 lines).** DONE 2026-06-04 (commit "Keep 8-digit leaf HTS lines..."). `parse_products()` keeps 8-digit leaves, pads to 10 with "00", drops non-leaf 8-digit rows in a post-pass. +473 hts10 (378 ch98, 95 ch91); Swiss watches now carry the 15% framework surcharge; zero rate changes on the pre-existing universe. New validation harness: `scripts/rebuild_one_revision.R` (single-revision scratch rebuild).
- [x] **2. Un-sweep general-purpose computers from 232 auto parts ($17.6B Taiwan ch84 gap).** DONE 2026-06-04. Note 33(g) legally lists bare `8471`, but its operative scope is "parts of passenger vehicles ... and light trucks" — a laptop is not one. New `applicability_shares_file` on the auto_parts heading config (`resources/s232_auto_parts_applicability.csv`, longest-prefix match; share 0 = excluded, fractional = rate blending); interim calibration 8471 = 0. Taiwan 8471 rate_232 → 0 except the 8471.80.4000 semi GPU line. Companion resolved: 8473 lines are CORRECT as-is — Annex II names only 8473.30 and all its children are already exempt; the 20% on 8473.21/.29/.40/.50 is statutory.
- [x] **3. India Annex II inheritance + ch98 across all EOs (~$2.3B).** DONE 2026-06-04. Legal text verified: note 2(z)(ii) routes India 9903.01.84 through heading 9903.01.86 to the FULL note 2(v)(iii) list (so Annex II DOES apply to India, unlike Brazil whose 9903.01.77 has its own enumerated list); every country-EO note carries the standard ch98 claim paragraph. New `country_eo_annex_ii_inherit: ['9903.01.84']` config + ch98 channel in both IEEPA blocks of `06_calculate_rates.R`. India 3004 → 0 on all 124 lines; Brazil 3004 stays 40% (correct); India/Brazil 9801 → 0.
- [x] **4. Re-run `expand_ieepa_exempt.R` (ch97 Berman).** DONE 2026-06-04. Re-ran against a refreshed universe (`scripts/refresh_product_caches.R`): +424 codes (378 new ch98 leaves, 30 ch97, 16 ch49). Audit removals preserved (0 PV codes, 0 non-8523.51). Write-back now preserves the date-window columns.
- [x] **5. Effective-date the IEEPA exempt list.** DONE 2026-06-04 — and bigger than scoped. `scripts/build_annex_ii_dates.R` extracts the note 2(v)(iii)(a) enumeration from every chapter-99 PDF, dates each entry by first appearance using the LEGAL amendment dates from the change records (electronics 2025-04-05 retroactive; EO 14346 metals/gold 2025-09-08; ag expansion 2025-11-13), and END-dates removals (copper → 232 PP 10962, exempt through 2025-07-31; wood → 232 PP 10976, through 2025-10-13; +405 windowed entries appended that were missing entirely). Loader filters in `06_calculate_rates.R` + `generate_etrs_config.R`. Also removed 74 ch06 entries — see discoveries below.
- [x] **6. USMCA eligibility false negatives.** DONE 2026-06-04. Two real root causes: (a) `extract_usmca_eligibility()` read each 10-digit item's own `special` field, but special lives on 8-digit LEGAL lines — statistical suffixes (~59% of HTS10s) were false-negative; now inherits via a legal-line stack (mirrors base-rate inheritance) and handles 8-digit leaves. (b) The h2_average share loader mapped zero-trade pairs to share 0 and absent pairs defaulted to 0 at the join; now zero-trade → NA and application falls back HTS10 → HS8 value-weighted share → 0 (fixes 2709.00.20.10 full-10% vs sibling ≈0). Residual: 7108.12.10.17 ($576M, observed claim share 0.001 with positive trade) — likely monetary gold; needs a bullion-channel decision (below).
- [x] **Companion (diagnostics): universe completeness check. DONE 2026-06-10.** `report_universe_completeness()` in `src/diagnostics.R` (wired into `run_all_diagnostics()`): per-revision comparison of the Census import-weights HS10 universe vs the snapshot universe, classifying each Census code as exact / hs8_drift (suffix concordance) / missing_line (true gap), with import-value shares; flags revisions with >0.1% of import value on missing lines; writes `output/diagnostics/universe_completeness.csv` + `universe_missing_detail.csv`. Skips gracefully when no weights file is present (unweighted/CI environments). Needs a weighted environment (cluster) to produce output — run with the next cluster build.

### Discoveries from the 2026-06-04 fix pass

- **revision_dates.csv is mis-dated for rev_25–31** — promoted to active priority 2 above.
- **ch06 flowers were never on the universal Annex II.** 0603/0601/0602/0604 appear ONLY on the Switzerland/Liechtenstein framework annex (2026 notes; `floor_exempt_2026_*.csv` country_group='swiss', 1,681 HTS8). The 74 universal-list ch06 entries (ETRs-alignment inheritance) wrongly exempted flowers for ALL countries — that, not ag-carve-out retroactivity, is the review's negative-eta ch06 cluster. Removed (Swiss imports stay exempt via the floor path). 4 ch06 entries with unknown provenance left in place.
- **No Swiss product exemptions exist in the 2025 HTS text.** rev_29–32 have no Swiss annex (first appears 2026_basic, where floor files already capture it). The rev_29–32 floor files are correct as-is; Nov-Dec 2025 Swiss floor applies without product exemptions per the HTS text of those revisions. If the framework annex was legally effective ~Nov 14 via CSMS ahead of HTS publication, modeling that would need the revision re-dating pass first.
- **Floor scraper hardening:** anchor regex now accepts "As provided FOR in heading(s)" (Nov 2025 restructured wording) and `parse_floor_exempt_products()` takes a per-vintage `targets` param (`scripts/regen_floor_exempt_2025.R` shows usage; ultimately not needed for rev_29–32 but keeps the scraper usable on post-restructure vintages).
- **Note 2(v)(iii)(b) "particular articles" list (9903.02.78: Etrogs, religious items)** is universal but not extracted/dated by `build_annex_ii_dates.R`; its entries are on the exempt list via ETRs alignment with NA dates (always active). Tiny trade; acceptable approximation, noted for completeness.
- **Other no-provenance entries left alone:** ~290 ch29, ~190 ch84/85 etc. exempt entries match no (iii)(a) text but reflect deliberate TPC/CSMS-aligned breadth (generic pharma, electronics clarifications). Do not blanket-remove.
- **Gold 7108 residual (deferred):** with USMCA fixes, the remaining Canada-gold gap concentrates in 7108.12.10.17 — high trade, near-zero observed USMCA claims, near-zero collected duties. Likely monetary/bullion channel (CBP treats bullion as non-dutiable under the Sept 2025 clarification, or the trade is monetary gold outside duty scope). Needs a legal-basis decision before hardcoding an exemption.

## Section 232 annex restructuring (April 2026 proclamation)

Presidential proclamation of 2 April 2026 replaces single-rate 232 with four product annexes (effective 2026-04-06). See `docs/s232/s232_metals_update_note.pdf` (SGEPT analysis).

### Annex transition result

- Pre-annex ETR: 11.12% (Apr 5, rev_4)
- Post-annex ETR: 11.79% (Apr 6, rev_5)
- Change: **+0.67pp** (vs SGEPT -0.53pp)
- The +1.2pp gap vs SGEPT is a known BEA vs calibrated-flat metal content divergence: our BEA shares produce low pre-annex effective rates for derivatives, making the move to 25% full-value a net increase. SGEPT's higher flat shares (steel 40%, aluminum 35%) make the pre-annex rates higher, so 25% is more often a reduction for them.

### Open work

Recommended order here: the rev_5 artifact sync / Russia fix has landed (active-priority #4, now DONE — `test_rate_calculation.R` green 92/0/0), so the release artifacts are in sync, and the re-dated rebuild has completed (2026-06-09 `release/` publish). Remaining: rebuild validation (active-priority #1) and the post-annex modeling/documentation items below.

**Prioritized assessment (2026-06-10), by expected ETR materiality ÷ effort:**
1. **Semi Phase-5 calibration** (below, §semiconductors) — CORRECTION 2026-06-10: the interim binary `qualifying_share` calibration ALREADY LANDED 2026-04-28 (`resources/semi_qualifying_shares.csv`: all 0 except 8471.80.4000 = 1), so the +0.57pp uncalibrated-upper-bound distortion is largely resolved. Remaining: `end_use_exemption_share` still 0.0 (uncalibrated) + empirical refinement of the binary shares.
2. ~~**UK 95% qualifying-content (9903.82.04/.05)**~~ **DONE 2026-06-10.** CORRECTION to the earlier claim: the UK reduced rates were NOT unmodeled — `uk_rate` (1a 0.25 / 1b 0.15) was applied UNCONDITIONALLY (implicit qualifying share 1.0) via the adapter's replace-mode override. What landed: `uk_content_qualifying_share` blend knob (adapter blends `q*uk_rate + (1-q)*annex_rate`); baseline 1.0 = legacy-identical; SGEPT 0.30 ships in `sgept_exemptions`. SIDE FINDING (not fixed, moves numbers): the UK override gates on chapters 72/73/76, but annex_1b (c)(vi)–(vii) derivative articles span chapters beyond the metals — the UK 1b reduced rate is likely UNDER-applied outside ch72/73/76. Needs its own scoping (the annex products CSV's metal_type is the right gate, not chapters).
3. ~~**Dormant exemption shares with SGEPT numbers**~~ **DONE 2026-06-10** — but the earlier "one-line config edit" claim was WRONG: only `us_origin_metal` had a consumer (and only in the annex_1c block); `de_minimis_weight` and `motorcycle_parts` were config scaffolds with NO code reading them. Consumers built in step 5c (zmc pattern): us_origin = 10% TARGET-TOTAL floor route per note 16(e) (floor_post_mfn semantics, verified against the Annex IV text), de_minimis = exempt-share scaling on 1b/3 excl. primary chapters (note 16(c) intro 15%-weight rule), motorcycle = exempt-share on 1b ch84/85/87 (note 16(g)). All dormant in baseline (byte-identical rev_9 verified); SGEPT estimates ship in `config/scenarios/sgept_exemptions/` (kind: scenario — NOT in the `--alternatives` selector, which is pinned to the historical 7). docs/assumptions.md §18.
4. **8471 annex_1b decision** — data-gated: wait for April+ 2026 Census collections (active-priority #2a); knobs already exist.
5. **Annex IV buckets + 9903.81.92 product-condition family** — SCOPED 2026-06-10 (see §"Annex IV scoping result" below): most buckets now modeled or dormant-knobbed; the genuine remainders are note 16(h)/(i) limited-quantity (defer), 16(k) 1c-parts end-use routes (defer, low materiality), and pre-annex 9903.81.92 (document-and-defer).
6. ~~**Russia clause (8) smelter/cast origin**~~ **DONE 2026-06-10 (document-and-defer as planned):** dormant `third_country_content_share: 0.0` knob on the Russia `country_surcharges` entry — the adapter pmax's `surcharge * share` onto all non-listed countries on the same aluminum product set when > 0. 0.0 is also the realistic value (post-2023 supply chains avoid Russian metal; CBP smelt-and-cast certs). Documented in assumptions.md §18; adapter tests cover blend + dormancy.
7. **rev_6 USMCA limited-quantity carve-out (9903.82.18/.19)** — needs quantity tracking the engine doesn't have; defer unless the eval shows a CA/MX vehicle-parts gap.

- [x] **Russia rev_5 release sync — DONE 2026-06-08** (same resolution as active-priority #4): the source fix landed (`section_232_annexes.country_surcharges` plus the post-annex `pmax()` path in step 5c) and the saved artifacts were re-synced; `tests/test_rate_calculation.R` passes 92/0/0 including Test 12 against the saved rev_5 artifact.
- [ ] **Russia clause (8) is still only partially modeled.** The April 2, 2026 proclamation covers Annex I-A/I-B/III aluminum articles or derivatives that are the product of Russia **or** where any primary aluminum was smelted in Russia **or** the article was cast in Russia. Current logic only keys on exporter country (`country == '4621'`). (NOTE: the previously-referenced `docs/s232/russia_rev5_fix_plan.md` does not exist; the related diagnosis lives in `docs/russia_surcharge_mhd_leak_fix_plan.md`.) Recommended treatment per assessment above: dormant share knob + document, don't build origin tracking.
- [x] **Narrow Russia `section_232_country_exemptions` to aluminum-only — DONE 2026-06-08** (commit `2724bb3` "Fix tariff policy edge cases"): the Russia 4621 entry now reads `applies_to: ['aluminum']` (config/policy_params.yaml ~line 278), and the annex-era `country_surcharges` block is likewise `metal_types: ['aluminum']` across annex_1a/1b/3. The local-machine `test_rate_calculation.R` check "Russia steel does NOT get the aluminum-only surcharge" is the pin for this; it passes on cluster/CI (fails locally only against the stale gitignored rev_5 snapshot).
- [x] **Document (or assign) `deriv_type` in annex-era revisions. DONE 2026-06-10** — comment approach, not sentinel. Block comment at the derivative-Ch99 gate in `apply_232_derivatives()` (`src/06_calculate_rates.R`) documents that the annex-era skip (deriv_type = NA, shares = 0 from rev_5 on) is the intended policy outcome, that `s232_annex` is the column downstream readers should use in the annex era, and WHY a sentinel must not be assigned: stacking gates per-type metal-share selection on `!is.na(deriv_type)`, and annex products are taxed full-value (`nonmetal_share = 0`), so a non-NA deriv_type would wrongly re-enable metal-content splitting. See `docs/s232/rev5_baseline_review.md` §§4-5.
- [x] **Rebuild release artifacts from HEAD — DONE** (covered by the 2026-06-08 artifact sync and the full re-dated rebuild published 2026-06-09): published outputs match the current tree; Russia snapshot tests pass on saved artifacts.
- [x] **Dynamic Ch99 parsing** in `load_annex_products()` / `extract_section232_rates()` — landed 2026-05-19 across 4 commits. `Rscript src/scrape_us_notes.R --annex` regenerates `resources/s232_annex_products.csv` by parsing Note 16(c)(i)–(x) from `data/us_notes/chapter99_<revision>.pdf` (initial parser `0d41a7b`; hardening `ed69eef` — auto-detects latest revision via `latest_local_chapter99_revision()`, derives effective_date from `policy_params.yaml::section_232_annexes.effective_date`, 25 tests in `tests/run_tests_annex_parser.R` wired into CI; methodology doc `59d2561` at `docs/s232/annex_parser.md`). Idempotent; curator entries (`source != 'us_note_16'`) win on prefix overlap so manual edge-case calls (annex_2 removals, (c)(ix) overrides) are preserved. Validated semantically against the curator baseline for rev_5 — 2652 codes assigned identically, 0 disagreements. Future Note 16 changes flow through automatically (rev_6's 9903.82.18/.19 USMCA carve-out reuses (c)(i)/(c)(iii) products that are already covered).
- [x] **9903.82.01 zero-metal-content carve-out — scaffolded** (`7250a0f`, 2026-05-19). Note 16(a) exemption for articles in (c) lists containing no aluminum/steel/copper. Added `section_232_annexes.exemptions.zero_metal_content` config block + step 5c rate-scaling branch in `06_calculate_rates.R` + 4 tests. Dormant (`aggregate_share = 0.0`); behaviorally a no-op until calibrated. **Calibration is its own item below.**
### Annex IV scoping result (2026-06-10) — note 16 bucket map

Annex IV of the April 2026 proclamation = the full replacement text of U.S.
note 16; the "exception buckets" are its conditioned subdivisions. Status:
16(a) zero-metal-content → dormant knob ✓; 16(c)-intro 15%-weight de minimis →
dormant knob ✓ (NEW); 16(d) UK 95% → qualifying-share blend ✓ (NEW); 16(e)
US-origin ≥85% 10%-target-total routes (9903.82.06–.08/.15/.23/.24) → dormant
knob, floor semantics ✓ (NEW); 16(f) non-US-origin 15%-target-total
(.10/.11/.25/.26) → already the annex_3 floor model ✓; 16(g) motorcycles →
dormant knob ✓ (NEW); 16(j) 1c USMCA 40% US-content cap (.20/.21) → modeled in
the 1c config ✓. Heading-level complements not separately modeled (.09, .12,
.14, .16, .17 — the per-heading col-1-threshold splits and "No change" routes
of (e)/(f); the floors capture the economics). Genuinely open:

- [ ] **Note 16(h)/(i): limited-quantity CA/MX steel/aluminum (9903.82.18/.19).** Commerce-authorized quantities under PP 10984 clause 13; authorization volumes are not published, the engine has no quantity tracking. DEFER until the eval shows a CA/MX primary-metals gap; the shape would be a per-country share knob calibrated to realized collections, not true quota logic.
- [ ] **Note 16(k): annex_1c parts end-use routes (9903.82.23–.26).** Ch84/85/87 parts used exclusively to manufacture ag/fixed/mobile industrial equipment get the (e)/(f) target-total floors. Low materiality (a slice of 1c parts trade, eff. 2026-06-08+). Shape if needed: an `applies_to`-style share knob on annex_1c parts mirroring us_origin_metal.
- [ ] **Pre-annex `9903.81.92` US-melted steel-derivative exemption (Mar 2025 – Apr 5 2026 window).** Same us_origin family as note 16(e) but on the PRE-annex derivative path ("duties apply to the non-steel content" for US-melted steel). Materiality tiny (~1% of derivative-steel duties for ~13 months). Document-and-defer; revisit only if the eval's 2025 §232 residuals point at it.
- [ ] **UK annex_1b coverage gate (side finding from the blend work):** the adapter's UK override gates on ch72/73/76, but (c)(vi)–(vii) annex_1b articles span other chapters — UK 1b reduced rate likely UNDER-applied outside the metal chapters. Fix = gate on the annex products CSV metal_type instead; MOVES NUMBERS (UK rows only) → parity-gated.

### Lower priority

- [x] ~~UK content share blending~~ DONE 2026-06-10 (assessment #2 above).
- [ ] Exemption share CALIBRATION (consumers all built 2026-06-10, dormant; SGEPT values ship in `config/scenarios/sgept_exemptions/`). Promote to baseline if the eval prefers the scenario; real calibration sources:
  - `us_origin_metal` (~1% per SGEPT)
  - `de_minimis_weight` (~2% per SGEPT)
  - `motorcycle_parts` (~0.1% per SGEPT)
  - `zero_metal_content` (9903.82.01 — no SGEPT estimate; would need per-prefix metal-content trade data, probably CBP entry-summary detail or industry surveys)
- [ ] Annex III sunset (Dec 2027 → I-B rate): logic in place, needs future HTS revision to test
- [ ] **Calibrate `auto_parts_subdivision_r` shares** — landed as dormant config knobs (all default 0). When set, step 5d in `06_calculate_rates.R` applies a three-way mix per Note 33(r): `rate_232 = fta × 0 + (1-fta) × [cert × floor + (1-cert) × annex_1b]`. The FTA exemption follows lines 35836-35837 (KORUS / EO 14345 imports exempt from 9903.94.44/.45/.54/.55/.64/.65 additional duty AND from 9903.82.x metals annex via the (r)(1) carve-out). Resource list is 8 prefixes (87060030, 87089210/.50/.60/.75, 87089315/.30, 87089981) at rev_6; rebuild via `scripts/build_subdivision_r_products.R` after annex updates.
  - **DataWeb does not provide direct chapter-99 granularity** (investigated 2026-05-02 via `src/download_subdivision_r_share.R`). `rateProvisionCodes` is a 2-digit aggregate, not 9903.xx-line specific.
  - **Upper-bound signals from DataWeb 2025**: `fta_exempt_shares.KR` ≤ 0.86 (SPI=KR utilization on subdiv-r ch87, $577M/$672M); `fta_exempt_shares.JP` ≈ 0 (US-Japan deal is not auto-scoped); `fta_exempt_shares.EU` = 0 structurally (no EU FTA in scope). `certified_share` (within the non-FTA slice) is undifferentiated.
  - Calibration source for certified_share: CBP entry-summary line counts (likely FOIA), industry estimates from MEMA / Auto Care Association / SAFE, or sensitivity-range defaults (e.g., set 0.5 with ±0.25 alternatives). See `tariff_tracker_investigated_issues.md`.
  - **Side gap still open:** the FTA-exempt branch only fires inside the subdiv-r blend. If a KORUS-qualifying KR import does NOT also claim subdivision (r) certification, the tracker still applies 25% annex_1b. Open question: should the FTA exemption apply to the 9903.82.x metals annex independent of subdivision (r) certification? Needs its own scoping pass.

### Ruled out (investigated 2026-04-22)

- [x] **Annex_2 × rate_232 = 0.25 is not a leak**: 480 rows at 25% in rev_5 snapshot, all semi products. Intentional per semi post-stacking override at `src/06_calculate_rates.R:2275-2298` (Note 39(a) — semi articles aren't re-scoped by the April 2026 annex restructuring). Zero non-semi annex_2 rows carry non-zero rates.
- [x] **IEEPA zeroing in rev_4+ is not a regression**: `rate_ieepa_recip = rate_ieepa_fent = 0` for all rev_4/rev_5 rows is the intended effect of `ieepa_invalidation_date: '2026-02-24'` (SCOTUS *Learning Resources v. Trump*). Section 122 replaces the blanket within the 150-day window.

### Completed

- [x] Config, resource CSV, helper, rate logic, 5 unit tests — scaffolding (2026-04-06)
- [x] Prefix-matching order: longest-first (2026-04-09)
- [x] `2026_rev_5` added (effective 2026-04-06) (2026-04-13)
- [x] Full-value stacking fix: `nonmetal_share=0` for annex products (2026-04-13)
- [x] Double-`resources/` path fix + fail-closed guard + quality invariant (2026-04-13)
- [x] Primary chapter coverage: removed `rate_232 > 0` guard, derivative fallback to annex_1b (2026-04-14)
- [x] ETR export: annex-aware program classification in `generate_etrs_config.R` (2026-04-14)
- [x] Integration tests: config-driven path, fail-closed, primary chapter, export parity, quality invariant — 79 tests total (2026-04-14)

## Section 232 semiconductor tariffs (Note 39 / 9903.79) — 2026-04-20

Flagged Apr 20, 2026: ETR shows **zero change** at 2026-01-16 (2026_rev_1 semiconductor tariff boundary). 9903.79 is parsed into ch99_data (rate=25%) but never reaches any product — no footnote on any HTS10 references 9903.79 because Note 39 scopes "semiconductor articles" in legal text rather than per-product footnotes. `snapshot_2026_rev_1.rds` has 0 of 4.74M rows with rate_other > 0; daily ETR is identical to the last digit across the rev_1 boundary (14.4333%).

The existing note in `docs/revision_changelog.md:21` — "handled through the normal Chapter 99 parsing path and do not require a separate override layer" — is wrong. The rate lands in ch99_data, but nothing links it to products. Same structural issue as Section 232 auto parts (required `resources/s232_auto_parts.txt` against US Note 33(g)).

### Note 39 legal scope (from `data/us_notes/chapter99_2026_rev_1.pdf` pp. 533–535)

- **Subdivision (b) product scope**: HTS headings **8471.50, 8471.80, 8473.30** (three headings only), AND a per-article technical gate requiring "logic integrated circuit" meeting TPP/DRAM bandwidth thresholds that target advanced AI accelerators (H100-class GPUs). Scope cannot be expressed purely in HTS codes — needs a `qualifying_share` blending parameter.
- **Subdivision (a) rate**: heading 9903.79.01 = 25% on "semiconductor articles of all countries" (country_type = `all`, parser currently emits `unknown`).
- **Subheadings 9903.79.02–09 end-use carve-outs**: USMCA (.02, via subdivision (c)), U.S. data centers >100 MW (.03), repairs/replacement (.04), R&D (.05), startups/emerging-growth-co's (.06), non-data-center consumer electronics (.07), non-data-center civil industrial (.08), U.S. public sector (.09). These are end-use, not HTS-scoped — need a separate `end_use_exemption_share` blending parameter.
- **Stacking exclusions in Note 39(a)**: semi articles are NOT subject to 9903.94.xx autos/auto parts, 9903.74.xx MHD/MHD parts, 9903.78.01 copper, 9903.85.02/.12 aluminum, or aluminum derivatives. Subchapter IV ch99 additional duties (IEEPA country-EOs) DO stack. IEEPA 9903.01.77 (Brazil) and 9903.01.84 (India) explicitly exempt semi articles per Note 2(v)(xv) and (v)(xiii). Universal IEEPA (9903.01.25) interaction still needs PDF verification.

### Landed (2026-04-21)

- [x] `resources/s232_semi_products.csv` (10 HTS10s under 8471.50 / 8471.80 / 8473.30) + `scripts/build_semi_products.R`
- [x] `resources/semi_qualifying_shares.csv` scaffold (all 1.0, uncalibrated upper bound)
- [x] `config/policy_params.yaml` `section_232_headings.semiconductors` entry (no USMCA carve-out per Note 39(a); `end_use_exemption_share` parameter)
- [x] `classify_authority()` routes `middle == 79` to `section_232`
- [x] `extract_section232_rates()` extracts `semi_rate` from 9903.79.01
- [x] `06_calculate_rates.R` heading loop: gate + router + setdiff semi products out of non-semi heading lists (auto_parts 8471 overlap)
- [x] `06_calculate_rates.R` per-HTS10 `qualifying_share` × `(1 - end_use_exemption_share)` scaling
- [x] `06_calculate_rates.R` post-stacking override: restores semi heading rate after derivatives + annex (handles 8473.30.20/.51 alum-derivative overlap, rev_5+ post-annex zeroing)
- [x] 10 new tests in `tests/test_rate_calculation.R` (60/60 passing): classify_authority, extract_section232_rates, 7 integration fixtures covering Note 39(a)(7)-(9), Note 2(v)(xvi), MX/CA fent exclusion, China 60% stack
- [x] `docs/revision_changelog.md` corrected (no longer claims "normal Ch99 parsing")
- [x] `docs/assumptions.md` new §16 documenting `qualifying_share` and `end_use_exemption_share` uncalibrated-upper-bound defaults
- [x] **Aggregate ETR impact measured: +0.57pp at Jan 15→16** (14.433% → 15.003% weighted). Uncalibrated upper bound — realistic ~0.05-0.20pp after Phase 5 calibration.

### Deferred (Phase 5, calibration)

- [x] **Calibrate `qualifying_share` per HTS10 — interim binary calibration DONE 2026-04-28** (`resources/semi_qualifying_shares.csv`): all lines 0 except 8471.80.4000 (discrete GPU/AI cards) = 1, per the Note 39(b) TPP/DRAM gate targeting H100/H200-class accelerators. Still flagged "upper bound" in the source notes — empirical refinement via CBP trade data or SIA/SEMI estimates remains optional follow-up.
- [ ] **Calibrate `end_use_exemption_share`** — fraction of qualifying imports routed through 9903.79.03–.09 carve-outs (data centers >100MW, repairs, R&D, startups, consumer, industrial, public sector). SCOPED 2026-06-10: post interim qualifying calibration the parameter only bites on `8471.80.4000` (GPU/AI cards), whose dominant importers are hyperscalers/data centers — the .03 route alone plausibly covers a MAJORITY, so the 0.3–0.5 guess may be conservative. BEST PATH IS EMPIRICAL AND AVAILABLE NOW: the eval side can measure the realized effective rate on 8471.80.4000 (Taiwan/China) from Jan 16 – Mar 2026 Census collections; realized ÷ 25% = qualifying_share × (1 − end_use_share) directly — hand to tariff-etr-adj rather than guessing. Interim option if a sensitivity series is wanted: a small scenario overlay (e.g. 0.4); do NOT change baseline until measured.
### Section 122 × semi stacking (investigated 2026-04-21, no fix needed)

Note 39(a)'s exclusion list doesn't cover 9903.03 (Section 122 Phase 3), so strictly per the legal text, s122 should stack on semi products. The tracker's `nonmetal_share = 0` mechanism for 232 products zeros s122 in stacking — conceptually wrong for semi, but the output is correct anyway because **all 8 semi HTS8 prefixes are already on `resources/s122_exempt_products.csv`** (1,656 HTS8 codes from the ITA exempt list). Verified: `rate_s122 = 0` across all 2,400 semi pairs in both rev_4 and rev_5 snapshots.

Net: tracker gives the right answer (0 s122 on semi) for two independent reasons. If a future policy change removed semi products from the s122 exempt list, the stacking mechanism would still zero s122 — which would then be a bug. Defer unless that happens.

### Effective date note

Legal effective date is **Jan 15, 2026 (12:01 am EST)** per the Jan 14 proclamation. `config/revision_dates.csv` has `2026_rev_1 = 2026-01-16` (HTS JSON publication date). Pre-existing tracker convention — same as Budget Lab Yale's Tariff-ETRs historical config. Not fixed here; would be a separate revision_dates cleanup.

## USMCA scenario and share-loading (2026-04-20, last audited 2026-05-19)

Investigation of `usmca_2024` / `usmca_monthly` alternatives and their behavior in the post-SCOTUS / post-annex regime. Originally three open items; two have since resolved silently (see "Completed" below). Only the snapshot rebuild remains.

### Findings

- **`usmca_monthly` was frozen at Dec 2025 for every 2026 revision.** `SCENARIO_SPECS` in `src/build_usmca_scenarios.R` hardcoded `year = 2025L`, and the monthly branch of `load_usmca_product_shares()` clamped `month_num = 12` whenever `effective_date > 2025-12-31`. `resources/usmca_product_shares_2026_01.csv` existed but was never loaded. In `output/alternative/daily_overall_usmca_monthly.csv` the post-Jan-2026 line tracked `usmca_h2avg` within 0.01pp as a direct consequence.
- **`usmca_2024` alternative is firing correctly.** Direct snapshot comparison at `2026_rev_5` (2026-04-06): CA `total_rate` 13.27% (main) vs 14.44% (2024), MX 13.82% vs 14.30%. s122 is the dominant channel (CA 4.80% vs 6.37%; MX 5.55% vs 6.42%). The small ~0.5pp overall-ETR gap in figure 5 is the correct weighted combination given CA/MX import shares and the fact that fentanyl (the big USMCA lever historically) is zeroed post-2026-02-24.
- **Section 122 does receive USMCA reductions for CA/MX** (contra an earlier claim I made). s122 is a universal blanket applied to every non-exempt product-country pair; step 7 of `06_calculate_rates.R` does `rate_s122 = rate_s122 * (1 - usmca_share)`. Verified at `2026_rev_4`: CA mean s122 8.54% (statutory) → 4.80% (effective); MX 8.54% → 5.55%. With IEEPA reciprocal + fentanyl zeroed post-SCOTUS, s122 is now the single biggest place USMCA bites.
- **Annex override does not refresh `s232_usmca_eligible`.** Step 4 sets `s232_usmca_eligible` from pre-annex heading configs (`usmca_exempt:` flag). Step 5c's annex rate override reclassifies products into annex_1a/_1b/_2/_3 but does not touch `s232_usmca_eligible`. A product newly swept into annex_1b that was not in any pre-annex heading list keeps `s232_usmca_eligible = FALSE`, so step 7 will not reduce its rate_232 for CA/MX even if the product is S/S+ in the HTS special field. Potential gap vs ETRs in the post-April regime.

### Completed

- [x] Rewrote monthly branch of `load_usmca_product_shares()` (`src/data_loaders.R:240-267`) to derive target year/month from `effective_date` and walk backward one calendar month at a time until a file is found. Caps at 120 steps; falls through to annual if nothing matches. Verified across 11 test dates from 2024 through 2026-10.
- [x] Removed hardcoded `year = 2025L` from `usmca_monthly` scenario spec (`src/build_usmca_scenarios.R:42`) and from the legacy `--with-alternatives` block in `src/09_daily_series.R:1005-1013`.
- [x] Patched `src/download_usmca_dataweb.R` so current-year queries use a Year-to-Date date range (`timeframeSelectType = 'specificDateRange'`, Jan-through-current-month) instead of `fullYears`, matching DataWeb support guidance for incomplete years.
- [x] **Annex-era `s232_usmca_eligible` refresh — landed in commit `35542ea` (2026-04-28).** `06_calculate_rates.R:2574-2583` re-derives the flag after the annex restructuring override: any annex_1a/1b/3 product that is USMCA-eligible (S/S+ in HTS) and NOT in steel/aluminum chapters (72/73/76) gets `s232_usmca_eligible = TRUE`. Existing passing test in `tests/test_rate_calculation.R` ("Annex-era s232_usmca_eligible refresh: CA/MX rate_232 reduced vs non-USMCA partner"). Re-audited 2026-05-19 against snapshot_2026_rev_5.rds: bulk of annex-era CA/MX S/S+ products correctly get rate_232 reduced; the residual cases that aren't reduced trace to legitimately zero `h2_average` USMCA share (months 7-12 2025 value-weighted), not a refresh bug.
- [x] **2026 monthly USMCA files refreshed (2026-05-03).** `resources/usmca_product_shares_2026_01.csv` and `_02.csv` now present (587KB / 590KB). DataWeb 503 resolved at some point between 2026-04-23 and 2026-05-03; downloader fix from `src/download_usmca_dataweb.R` worked once DataWeb returned. Per Hugh@DataWeb the latest available data is February 2026, so monthly walk-back from later dates correctly freezes at the 2026-02 file.
- [x] **Rebuilt `usmca_monthly` snapshots (2026-05-19, 95.3 min).** Ran `Rscript src/build_usmca_scenarios.R --scenarios usmca_monthly` — 41 per-revision snapshots written to `data/timeseries/usmca_monthly/`, plus 4 output CSVs in `output/alternative/` (daily_overall, by_authority, by_country, by_category). Output verified against expected behavior: 2025-04-15 delta vs baseline = +2.15pp (Q1 2025 utilization ~40-45% vs baseline H2 ~85%), step-up by 2025-07-15 to +0.17pp delta, flat to baseline through 2025-12, then small +0.04pp delta in 2026 reflecting the 2026_01/02 monthly files. Falls back to 2026-02 for dates after Feb 2026 as expected.

### Open work

- *(none — section closed 2026-05-19)*

## Code review findings (2026-04-15)

Critical and structural issues identified via full-repo code review.

### Critical

- [x] **Silent row multiplication from unchecked left_join** (`06_calculate_rates.R`): ~15 `left_join` operations on `rates` with no before/after row-count assertions. A duplicate key in any join table silently multiplies rows, producing incorrect rates. Add `relationship = 'many-to-one'` or post-join nrow checks.
- [x] **rowwise() on large expansion** (`06_calculate_rates.R:122-128`): `check_country_applies()` called row-by-row via `rowwise() %>% mutate()` on potentially millions of rows. Should be vectorized.

### Structural

- [x] **Module-level side effects** (`06_calculate_rates.R:43-61`): policy params loaded at source time into globals; tryCatch swallows config errors. Globals only serve `calculate_rates_fast()` and `check_country_applies()`. Fix: pass `ISO_TO_CENSUS` and `CTY_CHINA` as parameters, remove module-level globals, fail loudly at call time. ~20 line change.
- [x] **No integration tests for extract_* functions**: `extract_ieepa_rates()`, `extract_section232_rates()`, `extract_section122_rates()`, `extract_ieepa_fentanyl_rates()`, `extract_usmca_eligibility()` all have zero unit test coverage. These parse raw HTS JSON at the system boundary. Highest-value test: fixture-based assertions on a known revision's JSON.
- [x] **`helpers.R` is a 1,950-line junk drawer**: 46 functions across 12+ categories. Split into `policy_params.R`, `stacking.R`, `rate_schema.R`, `data_loaders.R`, `revisions.R`. helpers.R sources them for backward compatibility.
- [ ] **`calculate_rates_for_revision()` is 1,500+ lines** (`06_calculate_rates.R`): 19 numbered steps, clearly commented. Cross-step variable dependencies (auto_products, mhd_products, heading_gates flow from step 4 into steps 4b/4c/5/7) make extraction produce worse code than inline. Correctness risks already addressed (relationship guards, nonmetal dedup, tests). **Deferred — revisit if function grows past 2,000 lines or a step needs independent testing.**

### Minor

- [x] **Unreachable guard after stop()** (`06_calculate_rates.R`): redundant `if (file.exists(...))` after `stop()` on `!file.exists(...)`. Removed dead branch.

### Completed

- [x] Fix Annex III over-broad HTS prefixes for 3 headings (fee2769, closes #5) (2026-04-15)
- [x] Extract `compute_nonmetal_share()` to deduplicate stacking logic (f83f1b6) (2026-04-15)
- [x] Add `relationship = 'many-to-one'` to 21 lookup joins in `06_calculate_rates.R` (2026-04-15)
- [x] Replace `rowwise()` expansion with pre-computed applicability mapping in `calculate_rates_fast()` (2026-04-15)
- [x] Remove module-level side effects from `06_calculate_rates.R` — pass constants as parameters (2026-04-15)
- [x] Add `tests/test_rate_calculation.R`: 50 fixture-based tests for extract_*, invariants, stacking, parsing, schema (2026-04-15)
- [x] Wire `test_rate_calculation.R` into CI (2026-04-15)
- [x] Split `helpers.R` into 5 focused modules + architecture doc + CONTRIBUTING update (2026-04-15)

## Code review follow-ups (2026-04-22)

Second critical-code-reviewer pass over the Section 232 pipeline. Three commits
landed: `42c0cab` (blocking + required-changes), `0338405` (Phase C hardening).

### Blocking fixes

- [x] **Fentanyl stacking docstring/code divergence** (`src/stacking.R`): docstring claimed non-China fentanyl passes through at full rate on 232 products; code scales by `nonmetal_share`. Verified against Tariff-ETRs `calculations.R:1571-1575` — code is correct, docstring + misleading "copper exception" comment updated. Memory note corrected.
- [x] **Silent fail-open on `us_auto_content_share`** (`src/06_calculate_rates.R` step 4b, `src/generate_etrs_config.R`): missing config key previously defaulted to `1.0` (full USMCA exemption — ~4.7pp CA/MX auto over-exemption). Now fail closed with actionable error.
- [x] **Hardcoded UK `'4120'` for country overrides** (`src/05_parse_policy_params.R`): 9903.81.94-99 and 9903.85.12-15 previously attributed every entry to UK. New `extract_country_specific_overrides()` helper uses `parse_countries()` + ISO→Census map with EU expansion; warns on unparseable entries.

### Required changes

- [x] **`heading_gates` fail closed**: unregistered heading names now `stop()` with list of orphans rather than silently activating on every revision.
- [x] **`section_232_headings` required**: NULL block now errors rather than silently skipping non-chapter 232 programs.
- [x] **`message('WARNING: ...')` → `warning()`**: three sites (products_file, prefixes_file, semi qualifying_shares_file) — missing resources now surface in CI.
- [x] **`max_rate_with_variance_log()` helper** (parser): 8 `max(rate)` call sites log rate divergence if a ch99 range ever introduces a different rate instead of silently picking max.
- [x] **`match_232_heading_products()` helper** (`src/06_calculate_rates.R`): extracted the ~40-line prefix-matching logic duplicated in step 4 (rate assignment) and step 5 (derivative-overlap exclusion).
- [x] **`load_232_derivative_products()` cached**: loaded once per build and passed into both `apply_232_derivatives()` and the step 5c annex fallback.
- [x] **`aluminum_derivative_{rate,exempt}`**: renamed for symmetry with `steel_derivative_{rate,exempt}` (parser return, 06_calculate_rates.R consumer, test fixture).
- [x] **`vehicle_prefixes` fragile fallback** (step 4c auto deals): vehicle/parts split now sourced from `heading_product_lists` — stable if `autos_passenger`/`autos_light_trucks` ever migrate from inline `prefixes:` to `products_file:`.
- [x] **Auto-deal classification fail-loud** (`src/05_parse_policy_params.R`): parts regex extended (`auto parts`, `light trucks` variants); unclassifiable entries warn + drop rather than silently bucketing as `auto_vehicles`.

### Repo housekeeping

- [x] Repo metadata: `CITATION.cff`, `DATA_SOURCES.md`, `SECURITY.md` (`c4a4985`).
- [x] S232 reference PDFs + `annexes_text.txt` retained in `docs/s232/`; saved-page HTM bundle removed (`5bf88c3`).
- [x] `scripts/validate_derivative_classification.R` + `scripts/verify_scenario_differences.R` committed as durable validation tooling.
- [x] `.gitignore` additions: `test_output/`, `resources/USITC - USMCA - *.xlsx`, `resources/*_diagnostic.csv`.
- [x] Deleted 4 one-off migration scripts (`patch_and_test.R`, `scripts/diff_step1_refactor.R`, `scripts/verify_step2_dense.R`, `scripts/diagnose_tpc_match_shift.R`).

### Suggestion-tier follow-ups (deferred; low priority)

- [ ] O(N·M) annex prefix-matching at `src/06_calculate_rates.R:1797` — precompute into a hash for 10-15× speedup on large-annex revisions.
- [ ] Verify `load_metal_content()` isn't re-reading the BEA CSV per build.
- [ ] `statutory_rate_232` overloaded semantics — rewritten at 4 pipeline points (pre/post deal, post-annex, post-floor-recompute); consider renaming or explicit per-stage snapshots.

## Pipeline

Recommended order here: the counterfactual rerun now lives at Alternatives unification Step 5(b); leave generic pharma shares for later.

- [ ] Generic pharma country-specific exemption shares (per TPC feedback; low priority)
  - Planning note: `docs/analysis/generic_pharma_exemption_share_plan_2026-03-24.md`
- [x] USMCA 2026 monthly refresh — DONE; see "USMCA scenario and share-loading (2026-04-20)" above (section closed 2026-05-19).
- [x] ~~**Rerun 6 OOM-failed post-build alternatives (2026-04-22).**~~ DEDUPED 2026-06-10 — this is the same work as **Alternatives unification Step 5(b)** (the live checkbox; see that section). History: the 2026-04-22 `--full --with-alternatives` run completed the main timeseries + 6 rebuild alternatives but OOM'd on the 6 post-build scenarios (`cannot allocate vector of size 705.6 Mb`); `output/alternative/*_{no_*,pre_2025}.csv` are stale (Apr 15-20). The six counterfactuals are now `disabled_authorities` overlay scenarios; regenerate with `Rscript src/00_build_timeseries.R --alternatives counterfactuals --alternatives-only` on the cluster; fresh process per variant via `--parallel --alt-workers N` avoids the old OOM.

## More-granular preference share construction (2026-04-28)

Two share-refinement items surfaced by the eval `tracker_over_report.md` and `tracker_miss_report.md` Round 3. Both are about replacing or augmenting current preference-utilization inputs with finer, IMDB-empirical signals. Neither is a rate-parsing bug; they're calibration / new-channel work.

- [ ] **Refresh DataWeb USMCA monthly shares against IMDB-realized claim shares.** `tracker_over_report.md` Action 5: ~$43.3 B of LEGIT-channel over-statement on USMCA-claimed CA/MX entries indicates the tracker's monthly DataWeb shares are systematically lower than realized claim shares for some HS10×country pairs. Drill-down by HS6×country×month comparing `resources/usmca_product_shares_*.csv` to IMDB-derived (count or value of `cty_subco = 'S'/'S+'` divided by all entries in the same HS10×country×month) will identify which pairs need refresh. Same calibration pattern as the §232 semi `qualifying_share` interim fix. Eval-side handoff is the natural place to compute the IMDB-side aggregate; tracker-side change would be ingesting the refreshed shares.
- [ ] **Expose a statutory-vs-claimable rate split for the Annex II claim-rate channel.** `tracker_miss_report.md` Round 3 concluded the bulk of the $5–7 B Pattern 1 residual is importer non-claim of 9903.01.32 (eligible-but-unclaimed Annex II exemptions). Adding this as a behavioral channel parallel to USMCA shares requires the tracker to expose, per (HS10, country, revision), both (a) the statutory rate assuming 100% Annex II claim and (b) the rate if no Annex II is claimed. The diff is the upper-bound of the non-claim channel; the eval side then ingests an IMDB-derived claim share (count or value of `9903.01.32` filings vs. `9903.01.25/.43–.75/02.xx` filings by HS6×country×month) and decomposes via that share. The `ieepa_exempt_scope: 'baseline_only'` diagnostic toggle (committed 2026-04-28) already produces the no-claim rate; making this a first-class output requires emitting both rate columns side-by-side rather than rebuilding twice.

## Low priority

- **Concordance builder**: matching may overstate splits/merges. Tighten with reciprocal-best or capped matching if needed.
- **Small-country outliers**: persistent large gaps on low-import countries (Azerbaijan -26pp, Bahrain -22pp, UAE -8pp, Georgia +14pp, New Caledonia +22pp). Not material to aggregates.
