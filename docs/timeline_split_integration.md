# Unified timeline splitter — integration note (Pass-2 / P2-1)

**Status:** code + unit tests landed on `theseus`; golden re-freeze pending the array
build. This is a **behavior-changing** plank (it moves in-window numbers on 2025-03-12),
so it is validated by **statute invariants + a golden re-freeze**, NOT by parity vs the
old golden. Plan: `bright-gathering-waterfall.md`; supersedes the P2-1 stub in
`docs/spec_driven_calculator_plan.md`.

## What changed

The daily series was a step function over dated revision snapshots: a rate whose legal
effective date fell *between* two revisions could only turn on at the next revision —
late. Manual redating (`config/revision_dates.csv` `policy_effective_date`) hand-aligned
each revision to its *headline* event, but missed effective dates that aren't a
revision's headline.

We now make the timeline emerge from the snapshots. After the per-revision snapshots are
built, `discover_boundaries()` (`src/timeline.R`) finds every schedule boundary that
(a) falls **strictly inside** a real revision interval on the build grid, and (b) the
calculator's own date gates **re-resolve** on an as-of recompute. `build_boundary_mints()`
(`src/00_build_timeseries.R`) mints one synthetic `bnd_<date>` revision per boundary — the
owning revision's archive re-run **stamped at the boundary date**, with empty operations —
and `assemble_timeseries()` turns each mint into its own `[D, next]` interval via
`rev_dates` ordering (auto-shortening the owner to `D-1`). No calculator change: the date
gates already do the work.

This is the baseline-eligible generalisation of `build_scheduled_activations()` (the
future turn-ON mechanism): arbitrary owner archive (not just the tip), empty operations
allowed (the change is the as-of date itself), a distinct `bnd_` prefix, idempotent, and
**part of the baseline/golden** (scheduled activations are scenario-only).

## The mintable set (verified on the production policy grid, 2026-06-06)

A systematic scan of the cached `ch99_<rev>.rds` parses + the config dates produced
**exactly three** boundaries:

| boundary    | owner        | source                              | window | what it fixes |
|-------------|--------------|-------------------------------------|--------|---------------|
| 2025-03-12  | `rev_4`      | §232 country-exemption expiry       | IN     | CA/MX/EU/UK/JP/KR/AU/BR/AR/UA steel+aluminum jump 0→25% on 03-12, not at rev_5 (03-14) |
| 2026-02-20  | `2026_rev_3` | IEEPA invalidation (SCOTUS)         | out    | reciprocal + fentanyl → 0 on 02-20, not at 2026_rev_4 (02-24); opens the genuine 4-day [02-20,02-23] window where IEEPA **and** S122 are both 0 (S122 starts 02-24) |
| 2026-11-10  | `2026_rev_9` | §301 Ch99 `effective_date_offset`   | out    | 9903.91.12–.16 (intermodal chassis + ship-to-shore gantry cranes, China) turn ON 2026-11-10 — previously masked **forever** by `filter_active_ch99` (no real revision is dated ≥ 11-10) |

Two findings corrected the plan's assumptions:

1. **2025-03-12 is NOT a Ch99 offset.** The plan expected a "Mar-12 derivative offset" to
   auto-discover it; the scan found none, and the §232 derivative codes (9903.81.89–.93,
   9903.85.04/.07/.08) are present in `rev_4` **ungated** (already active). The real signal
   is the `section_232_country_exemptions` `expiry_date` (the adapter gate
   `rev_date < expiry`, `authority_adapter.R`), which `collect_schedule_boundaries()` does
   not carry — so `discover_boundaries()` adds §232 country-exemption expiries as a
   first-class source.
2. **2026-11-10 is a real discovery** (not in the plan). It is the genuine
   scheduled-turn-ON gap (`scheduled-activations-gap`): real §301 entries dated "on or
   after November 10, 2026" that the current pipeline never activates.

### Discovered data gap: the 2026-11-10 §301 mint is currently daily-INERT

The validation build (job 13905511/512, golden `70b6b97`) showed the impact is exactly
the intended set and nothing else: **6 daily rows move, all inside the boundary windows,
0 outside** (regression guard green). 2025-03-12/13 = +0.22pp (§232 exemption); 2026-02-20→23
= −9.2pp (IEEPA reciprocal pulled forward 4 days). **2026-11-10 shows NO daily movement.**

Reason: the §301 crane/chassis codes `9903.91.12`/`.14` carry a parsed **100%** rate in the
Ch99 text, but the calculator assigns `rate_301` **only** from the `section_301_rates` config
lookup (`06: s301_rate_lookup` inner-join), and `9903.91.12–.16` are **not in that list**
(`.13/.15/.16` are conditional "notwithstanding/except" provisions). So activating them adds
no rate — `bnd_2026-11-10` differs from its owner snapshot only in `rate_s122` (the S122
sunset, which the downstream zeroing already applies to that date range), leaving the daily
series unchanged.

**This is a genuine modeling gap the systematic scan surfaced — separate from the timeline
mechanism, which is correct.** The boundary is properly discovered + minted, and the mint is
**forward-compatible**: the moment `9903.91.12`/`.14` (and the conditional `.13/.15/.16`) are
priced into `section_301_rates`, `bnd_2026-11-10` will reflect them with no further timeline
work. Pricing them (with their USMCA / exception handling) is a follow-up data task with its
own validation. `tests/test_timeline_invariants.R` asserts the documented daily-inert state
now and auto-strengthens to "footprint grows" once the codes are priced.

Edge-coincident boundaries correctly produce **no mint** (they sit on a real revision's
date): 2025-04-09 (Phase-1 country rates = `rev_8`), 2025-05-03 (auto parts = `rev_11`),
2026-04-06 (§232 annex = `2026_rev_5`), 2026-04-01/2026-07-24 (Swiss/S122 expiries — see
below).

## Mutual-exclusion rule (R4/R8: recompute-vs-zeroing drift)

A boundary is handled by **exactly one** mechanism:

- **mint** (this plank): boundaries the calc re-resolves on recompute — Ch99 offsets,
  IEEPA invalidation, §232 country-exemption expiries.
- **downstream zeroing** (`09_daily_series` + `helpers.R::apply_expiry_zeroing`): the
  **SECTION_122 / SWISS expiries**. These are **NOT minted**; `discover_boundaries()`
  subtracts `expiry_boundaries()` from the config set.

Why expiries stay on zeroing (`tests/test_mint_equals_zeroing.R` proves it):
- **S122** — mint ≡ zeroing (the calc gate `eff <= expiry_date` zeros `rate_s122` exactly
  as the downstream zeroing does), so moving it would be a pure refactor with no gain.
- **SWISS** — mint ≠ zeroing. `apply_expiry_zeroing` *forces* CH/LI `rate_ieepa_recip` to
  0 (the pre-floor surcharge isn't stored in the snapshot). A recompute merely turns OFF
  the floor override and **reverts to the underlying surcharge** — nonzero whenever IEEPA
  is live. They diverge structurally; they coincide today only because IEEPA is invalidated
  (02-20) before the Swiss expiry (03-31), a fragile regime accident.

The 09 expiry splitter is therefore **left unchanged** (the plan's optional Stage-3 swap of
`09:~326` is deliberately NOT done) — `tests/test_timeline_realdata.R` keeps the
live-≡-legacy parity assertion green.

## Wiring

`discover_boundaries()` + `build_boundary_mints()` run immediately **before**
`build_scheduled_activations()` in both post-array sites:
`build_full_timeseries()` (`src/00_build_timeseries.R`) and `scripts/build_gather.R`. The
mints are **not** fed to the 09 splitter (the mint already creates the interval; feeding it
would duplicate the owner). `build_scheduled_activations()`'s tip selection was hardened to
pick the latest **real** revision (a `bnd_` row can now hold the latest `effective_date`).

`config/policy_params.yaml` gains an empty `boundary_overrides: []` block (a curated
backstop, loaded as `pp$BOUNDARY_OVERRIDES`) — empty because all three boundaries are
auto-discovered.

## Tests

- `tests/test_boundary_discovery.R` — discovery emits exactly the three boundaries with the
  right owners/sources, drops edges + expiries, owner-is-interior, idempotency. (26 ✓)
- `tests/test_mint_equals_zeroing.R` — S122 mint≡zeroing, SWISS mint≠zeroing, expiries
  excluded from the mint set. (9 ✓)
- `tests/test_timeline_realdata.R` — kept the live-≡-legacy 09 splitter parity (42
  intervals) + a discovery positive control (R1/R6). (4 ✓)
- `tests/test_timeline_invariants.R` — absolute rate-state assertions on the built
  snapshots (skips until a build produces the `bnd_` snapshots): §232 exemption flip on
  03-12, IEEPA+fentanyl=0 on 02-20, the 02-20→02-24 both-zero window, S122 on 02-24, §301
  cranes on 11-10, and no-spurious-split positive controls.

## Golden re-freeze (after the array build lands + invariants pass)

Stage 1 moves in-window numbers (the 03-12 cluster, 2 days × the exempted countries'
steel/aluminum), so the golden must be re-frozen:
1. `GATHER_ARGS="--unweighted" bash scripts/submit_build_array.sh` → `afterok` gather (now
   mints the three `bnd_` snapshots post-array).
2. Run `tests/test_timeline_invariants.R` against the new build (must be green).
3. `scripts/report_timeline_split_impact.R` → `output/timeline_split_impact/` (expect the
   §232 bump on CA/MX/EU/UK/JP/KR around 2025-03-12; 2026 IEEPA/301 changes out-of-window).
4. Re-capture the golden via `scripts/capture_parity_golden.R` (+ `build_parity_manifest.R`)
   into `tests/golden/<new_sha>/`; update `policy_params_md5` and `n_snapshots`. **The
   capture must contain exactly the real + three `bnd_` snapshots.** R5 safety net:
   `scripts/summarize_parity_results.R` fails the parity run (exit 1) on any golden-only OR
   candidate-only artifact — so a stale golden missing the `bnd_` snapshots, or an
   unexpected synthetic snapshot in the candidate, turns parity RED rather than green-on-bad.
   (`build_parity_manifest.R` itself only compares the shared intersection; the refusal lives
   in the summarizer.) Retain `70b6b97` for provenance.

**New golden captured: `tests/golden/6ec81b9`** (2026-06-06) — 45 snapshots (42 real + the
3 `bnd_` mints, manifest lists exactly `bnd_2025-03-12` / `bnd_2026-02-20` / `bnd_2026-11-10`),
weighted daily CSVs, `policy_params_md5 = 361cf48e65720fab364e0e4f3a5f846c`,
`use_policy_dates = true`, `src_config_dirty = false`, `has_timeseries = false` (array path
skips the monolith). Validated surgical vs the prior golden: 6 daily rows move, all inside the
boundary windows, 0 outside. Prior golden **`70b6b97` retained** for provenance.
