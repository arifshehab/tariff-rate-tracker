# AuthoritySpec — a unified authority parameter schema for counterfactual scenarios

**Status:** design proposal (revised) · **Date:** 2026-06-03

> **Resolved design decisions** (see also the review that produced them):
> 1. Supports all four scenario kinds — disable, rate bump/floor, **re-scope to new
>    countries**, and **add new coverage**. The last two require recompute, not panel edits.
> 2. A scenario is a **synthetic future revision**; only intervals at/after its
>    `effective_from` are recomputed (dates before are reused baseline unchanged).
> 3. **Statutory scope only.** ETR adjustment knobs (USMCA utilization, auto rebate,
>    metal-content method, subdivision-r, de-minimis) live in a separate
>    `adjustment_params` dimension. A scenario = `{policy} × {assumptions}`.
> 4. Migration parity is **numeric tolerance**, not byte-identical.
> 5. Scenario files use **Census codes** (validated; fail loud on unknown), with two
>    distinct alias namespaces resolved to sets: **authority-group** aliases (`ieepa`
>    → reciprocal + fentanyl) and **country-group** aliases (`eu27`; `swiss` →
>    {Switzerland, Liechtenstein}). The two resolve and validate separately.
> 6. **Current law is a time path** (it embeds scheduled future changes). Baseline
>    defaults to **current-law**; **current-policy** is a canned scenario that cancels
>    the IEEPA/s122 sunsets (other scheduled changes — annex restructuring, annex_3
>    sunset — still bend the path). A past `base:` is an **effective-date** cut: include
>    every revision effective on-or-before the pin plus changes already scheduled as of
>    then. The data records only effective dates, not enactment dates, so
>    "enacted-after-pin" is not separable — the pin is defined on effective date.
> 7. IEEPA invalidation stays a per-authority `until`, with an `ieepa` group alias so
>    one operation flips reciprocal + fentanyl together.
> 8. Authored 232 programs that overlap existing coverage resolve by **precedence**
>    (rate-independent exclusions first, then highest-rate-wins among the remainder).
>    A rate *cut* needs an explicit **replace** op — it cannot win a `max`.

## Motivation

Today the Budget Lab tariff pipeline runs three repos:

```
tariff-rate-tracker  →  tariff-etrs  →  tariff-model
(statutory rates)       (ETR engine)     (revenue + macro)
```

This is awkward in two ways: the tracker *also* emits ETR output, so there are
two calculator engines kept in lockstep by hand; and counterfactual scenarios
live downstream in ETRs, where they can only overlay the tracker's *flat*
per-product-country rates — they cannot add new tariff coverage or re-scope an
authority across countries.

The goal is to give **tariff-rate-tracker** first-class counterfactual
simulation, then point **tariff-model** directly at it — dropping the
two-engine overlap. This document specifies the data model that makes that
possible: a single per-authority parameter structure (`AuthoritySpec`) that the
baseline parser *produces* from the HTS JSON and the scenario layer *mutates*,
so that **baseline is literally the empty scenario.**

## Pipeline shape: what "params" means and where AuthoritySpec sits

The word *params* is overloaded in this repo; disambiguate before reading on:

- **parsed params (per-authority data)** — `products`, `ch99_data`, `ieepa_rates`,
  `s232_rates`, `fentanyl_rates`, `usmca`. Produced by the `03/04/05` parsers from
  the HTS JSON. Each authority's object is **a different shape**: `s232_rates` is a
  21-field named list (`05:1033`); `ieepa_rates` is a tibble (`05:214`);
  `fentanyl_rates` is yet another tibble.
- **`policy_params.yaml`** — hand-authored constants (country codes, floor rates,
  232 heading definitions). **Not** parsed from JSON; you edit it directly.

AuthoritySpec normalizes the *parsed per-authority params* (plus the relevant slices
of `policy_params.yaml`) into **one uniform shape**. It does **not** change the
parsing, and it does **not** change the calculator's math — only the calculator's
input interface. The translation runs on **every** build; a scenario is just the
same path with one extra step (apply operations to the specs). That is what
"baseline = empty scenario" means literally.

```

                                                                                 ▼  RATE PANEL — identical (parity-gated)

AFTER (scenario)  …specs ──★apply operations──▶ specs′ ──▶ calculate_rates_for_revision(specs′, …) ──▶ counterfactual panel
```

What changes / what does not:

| Layer | Changes? |
|---|---|
| Parsing logic (regex / JSON reading, `03/04/05`) | **No** — untouched |
| `param-object-1 → AuthoritySpec` adapter | **New** |
| Calculator *input interface* (signature + how it reads inputs) | **Yes** — re-plumbed |
| Calculator *math* and *output* (the RATE_SCHEMA panel) | **No** — preserved, parity-gated |

The brittle prose-parsing in `03/04/05` is a real but **separate** concern; folding a
parser rewrite into this migration would conflate two jobs and inflate parity risk.
The adapter wraps the existing parser output as-is (migration step 1 below).

## The core idea: a scenario is a synthetic future revision

The repo's spine is already "on date *D*, the rate panel changes to *X*" — that
is what an HTS revision *is*, and why every downstream artifact (interval
encoding, `delta_*.rds`, daily series, ETRs) is derived from the panel rather
than computed specially.

A presidential announcement effective end of July is functionally **a revision
that USITC has not published yet.** So a scenario is a *hypothetical revision*
layered on the tip of the baseline panel and recomputed forward from its
`effective_from` (dates before are reused baseline, untouched).

**The tip is itself a time path, not a flat rate.** Current law as of any date
already encodes scheduled future changes — but they reach the timeline through
**two different mechanisms today**, which the new engine must unify:

- **Expiries** (s122 sunset, Swiss-framework expiry 2026-03-31) are split into
  sub-intervals *after* the panel is built, by `collect_expiry_adjustments` /
  `get_expiry_split_points` (defined in `src/helpers.R:391,469`; invoked from
  `09_daily_series.R`).
- **Activation offsets** (`effective_date_offset`) are handled *earlier and
  differently* — `filter_active_ch99` (defined in `src/rate_schema.R:220`, called
  at `06:719`) gates them per revision at calc time. The expiry splitter does
  **not** create a sub-interval at a mid-interval Ch99 activation offset.

So the baseline path *is* multi-interval, but it is **not** one unified splitter
today (an overstatement to avoid). A scenario must therefore *compose* with this
scheduled path, and the synthetic-revision timeline must **explicitly collect every
schedule boundary** into one splitter (see implementation requirements below). This
keeps baseline and counterfactual symmetric: all downstream derivations work unchanged.

### Where the scenario injects: the parameter layer (not JSON, not the panel)

The pipeline has three layers:

```
A. HTS JSON archives                                  ← raw (never synthesized)
B. Parsed parameters: products, ch99_data,            ← THE INJECTION SEAM
     ieepa_rates, fentanyl_rates, s232_rates, usmca
     + policy_params.yaml
C. calculate_rates_for_revision(B...) → rate panel → stacking → daily / ETR
```

`calculate_rates_for_revision()` (`src/06_calculate_rates.R:704`) already takes
the Layer-B objects as named arguments. A scenario therefore = **build a
modified Layer-B parameter set and call the same function.** All of Layer C's
logic (metal-share assignment, USMCA scaling, stacking) re-runs on the delta for
free — "the calculator still holds," structurally guaranteed.

We do **not** synthesize fake JSON (Layer A), and we do **not** post-process the
output panel (Layer C) — which is what the current `src/apply_scenarios.R` does,
and exactly why it is limited to column edits and cannot introduce coverage or
set archetype tags correctly.

## The schema

`AuthoritySpec` is one envelope every authority uses. The only genuinely complex
authority is Section 232 (steel, autos, copper… each with its own
products/rate/deals), so we model that as a **list of programs**. Simple
authorities (301, s122, s201) are an authority with exactly one program.

```yaml
section_232:
  stacking:
    class: primary_metal          # default; overridable per program (autos use primary_full)
  usmca_treatment: per_program    # 232 varies by program; others set it here
  active: { from: 2025-03-12, until: null }   # null = open-ended
  programs:
    - id: steel
      product_scope: { chapters: ['72','73'] }
      country_scope: { include: all, exclude: [] }    # country exemptions here
      rate:
        default: 0.50
        overrides: { '4120': 0.25 }                   # UK deal — plain SET (not a floor)
      metal: { type: steel, content: full }           # 232-only block
      active: { from: 2025-03-12 }
    - id: autos_passenger
      product_scope: { prefixes: ['870322','870323', ...] }
      country_scope: { include: all }
      rate:
        default: 0.25
        target_total: { eu27: 0.15, '5880': 0.15 }    # all-in FLOOR: max(value-base,0); JP=5880
      usmca_treatment: eligible                        # statutory eligibility only;
                                                       # content-share scaling → adjustment_params
      stacking: { class: primary_full }                # full customs value, not metal-content split
      metal: { type: none }
      active: { from: 2025-04-03 }
```

The **same envelope** for a "simple" authority — Section 301, with the China
gate now a field instead of a hardcoded `if`:

```yaml
section_301:
  stacking: { class: additive }
  usmca_treatment: none
  active: { from: 2018-07-06, until: null }
  programs:
    - id: s301
      product_scope: { list_file: resources/s301_product_lists.csv }
      country_scope: { include: ['5700'] }    # China; was `if (country == cty_china)`
      rate: { by_product_tier: from_list }    # 7.5% / 25% carried by the list file
```

And IEEPA fentanyl — the country-dependent stacking wrinkle, expressed as data:

```yaml
ieepa_fentanyl:
  stacking:
    class: content_split            # scaled by nonmetal_share on 232 products...
    exceptions: { china: additive } # ...except China, which passes through full
  usmca_treatment: exempt
  active: { from: 2025-02-04, until: 2026-02-24 }   # IEEPA invalidation; flip via the
                                                    # `ieepa` group alias (recip + fentanyl together)
  programs:
    - id: fentanyl
      product_scope: { include: all }
      country_scope: { include: ['5700','1220','2010'] }   # CN/CA/MX; freely extendable
      rate:
        by_country: { '5700': 0.20, '1220': 0.25, '2010': 0.25 }
        product_overrides_file: resources/fentanyl_carveout_products.csv
        # NOT an exclusion list — these are per-product LOWER/higher rates (e.g. potash
        # +10%): the engine does coalesce(carveout_rate, fent_rate, 0) (`06:1195`).
        # Modeling it as exclude_file would zero them and understate the rate.
      # True exemptions (Ch98 9802.00.40/50/60/80) are separate — they zero the rate
      # (`06:1230`) and belong in an exempt_file, not here.
```

### Field reference

Every field maps to something the current engine already does — this is a
*normalization* of existing behavior, not new policy.

| Field | Purpose | Where it lives today |
|---|---|---|
| `stacking.class` | `primary_metal` (232, owns the metal-content fraction — **requires a real `metal.type`**) / `primary_full` (232 owns the **full** customs value, IEEPA excluded — for non-metal 232 like autos/drones; no metal block) / `content_split` (scaled by `nonmetal_share` on 232 products — IEEPA recip, s122, CA-MX fentanyl) / `additive` (full rate always — 301, s201, other, China fentanyl) | the `case_when` branches in `src/stacking.R` |
| `stacking.exceptions` | per-country-group override of the class — captures "China fentanyl is additive while others content-split" **as data, not a branch** | hardcoded `country == cty_china` in the fentanyl branch |
| `country_scope` | `{include: all \| [list], exclude: [list/file]}` — the set membership the engine iterates (`country %in% scope`) | hardcoded for 301/fentanyl; parsed-as-data for 232/IEEPA |
| `product_scope` | `{chapters \| products_file \| prefixes_file \| prefixes, exclude_file}` — **a precedence, not alternatives**: `products_file` (authoritative CSV) wins; `prefixes_file` / inline `prefixes` are the fallback used only when no file is present (`06:234-290`). (The draft's `list_file` is this `products_file`.) | `section_232_headings`, resource CSVs |
| `rate` | `{default, by_country, overrides, target_total, by_product_tier}` — distinct mechanisms: `overrides` / `by_country` are plain SETs (per-HS8 / per-country); `target_total` is an all-in FLOOR `max(value − base, 0)` where **`base` is the MFN layer** (see "Baseline semantics → MFN/base"); 232 country deals carry a `kind: floor \| surcharge` (`06:1754`); the IEEPA surcharge-vs-floor switch is a country-group case. **Floor timing is not uniform:** 232 deal floors are computed once at step 4c (`06:1750`) against the *original* base and are **not** recomputed after MFN; only the IEEPA-recip floor (6d, `06:2497`) and Annex-III floor (6e, `06:2511`) recompute against post-MFN base. | scattered: `s232_rates`, `section_301_rates`, deal floors (`06:1750`), surcharge/floor switch (`06:964`), ch99 extraction |
| `usmca_treatment` | statutory **eligibility metadata**: `exempt` / `eligible` / `none`. The utilization *math* lives in `adjustment_params`. **Reality note:** on the live share-path this flag is **not** itself a calc input for base/recip/fent/s122 — the per-product USMCA share already encodes eligibility (`06:2524`); and 232-auto eligibility is *recomputed* from annex membership mid-calc (`06:2574`), not read from a static tag. Treat the flag as documentation/validation metadata, not the operative input on that path. | `*_usmca_exception` flags + per-program `usmca_exempt`; utilization/eligibility at `06:2522-2646` |
| `active.{from,until}` | activation window — **what a synthetic revision sets**; `until` also models IEEPA invalidation. **`until` is the first inactive day** ("dead from", exclusive): the program is active for dates `< until`. This matches IEEPA invalidation (`effective_date >= until` zeroes, `06:754`) but **not** the expiry splitter, which today treats the expiry date as the last *active* day (`query_date > expiry`, `helpers.R:436`) — the engine must converge the two onto one convention. | `effective_date`, heading gates, `IEEPA_INVALIDATION_DATE` |
| `metal` (232-only) | `{type: steel\|aluminum\|copper\|none, content: full\|share}` → drives `metal_share`/`nonmetal_share`. Omit the whole block for `primary_full`/non-metal programs; `content` is required only for content-bearing types. | `deriv_type`, `metal_content`, `s232_annex` |

What disappears into fields: the **heading gate**
(`grepl('9903.94...', ch99_code)`) becomes `active.from`; the **China `if`**
becomes `country_scope`; the **`*_usmca_exception` flags** become
`usmca_treatment`. Each hardcoded thing becomes data.

The four `stacking.class` names (`primary_metal` / `primary_full` / `content_split` /
`additive`) are **normalized labels introduced here, not literal code symbols** — the live
code uses `case_when` branches and `stacking_method` values (`mutual_exclusion` /
`tpc_additive`); don't grep for the class names.

### Baseline semantics the field list must still absorb

The table above is necessary but **not sufficient** for parity. The live
calculator carries behavior the current draft drops; each must land either as an
explicit field or as an explicit pointer into `adjustment_params`, or baseline
will not reproduce:

- **MFN / base-rate layer** — the `base` that `target_total`'s `max(value − base, 0)`
  floors against is itself a first-class layer: deal floors `pmax(deal$rate − base_rate, 0)`
  (`06:1750`), the IEEPA floor (`06:1059`) and Annex-III floor (`06:1991`) all subtract it,
  and MFN exemption shares reduce it (`06:2474`). No spec carries it today. Model it as an
  explicit `mfn` authority (scope = all products, rate = `products$base_rate`), with
  `mfn_exemption_shares` as its `adjustment_params`; otherwise "baseline = empty scenario"
  cannot reproduce the floors.
- **IEEPA phase precedence** — Phase 2 + country-EO entries stack *across* phases; Phase 1
  is **superseded** (rank-2 in `active_rank`, dropped when a later phase exists, `06:863`).
  *Within* a phase the country entry supersedes the group and the highest wins
  (Brazil 10%+40%=50%, Tunisia max(15%,25%)=25%). `06:856-889`.
- **IEEPA universal baseline** — a 10% default applied to every country *not* in the explicit
  entry list and not USMCA-exempt (`06:975-987`), read from `attr(ieepa_rates,'universal_baseline')`.
  This is a default-for-the-complement, structurally distinct from per-country `by_country`;
  model it as an explicit `default_unlisted_rate` on the reciprocal spec.
- **IEEPA `passthrough` rate_type** — a *third* type beyond surcharge/floor (`05:282`, `06:1060`):
  base-rate-only, no additional duty (high-duty goods for floor countries). The surcharge-vs-floor
  switch must be three-way.
- **Country-EO exemptions vs Annex A** — country EOs (Brazil 9903.01.77 …) must
  bypass the universal Annex A or they are wrongly suppressed. `06:801`.
- **Floor-product exemptions** — `floor_exempt_products` zero the reciprocal rate
  for exempt HS8×country-group pairs (`06:1053`; the key set is built at `06:997`).
- **Typed exempt lists** — at least three distinct exempt roles, scoped to different
  authorities, must stay separate: Annex-A/II reciprocal exempt (`ieepa_exempt_products.csv`,
  scope gated by `ieepa_exempt_scope`), the Ch98 fentanyl set (next bullet), and country-EO
  date windows (`06:812`). Each needs a target authority, key granularity, optional date
  window, and whether it zeros the whole rate or only one component.
- **Ch98 fentanyl carve-out** — US Note 2(v)(i): the 9802.00.40/50/60/80 set zeros
  `rate_ieepa_fent`. `06:1230`. This is a *true exemption* (→ `exempt_file`).
- **Fentanyl product carve-outs** — `fentanyl_carveout_products.csv` is a per-product
  **rate-override** list (potash/energy at a *lower* rate), `coalesce(carveout_rate,
  fent_rate, 0)` (`06:1195`) — **not** an exclusion. It belongs under `rate`
  (`product_overrides_file`), never `exclude_file`. Two different file roles —
  rate-override vs scope-exclusion — must stay distinct in the schema.
- **Fentanyl multi-entry supersession** — `max(rate)` per country across multiple general
  fentanyl entries (China 9903.01.20 +10% superseded by 9903.01.24 +20%), plus an
  `entry_type` partition (general vs carveout) joined by HS8×country (`06:1162-1184`).
- **Section 301 active/suspended + Biden/Trump supersession** — 301 Ch99 codes whose
  description says "provision suspended" are dropped (e.g. 9903.88.16 List 4B), and
  `max(s301_rate)` per HS8 supersedes across Trump-era (9903.88) and Biden-era (9903.91)
  lists (`06:2237-2266`). A per-code active/suspended status behaves like an activation window.
- **Wood / lumber 232 program** — softwood vs furniture/cabinet product sets with separate
  deals (UK 10% floor on softwood; EU/JP/KR 15% floor on furniture), `06:1304-1416`,
  `06:1770-1816`. Absent from the 232 examples; it is a real heading program with internal subsets.
- **Date-bounded per-country 232 overrides** — `section_232_country_exemptions` (date-bounded
  TRQ/quota exemptions with `expiry_date`) and `country_surcharges` (permanent Russia 200%
  aluminum, applied via `pmax`, `06:1517`/`06:2047`) are per-country, metal-/annex-scoped, dated
  rate overrides with no current schema home. Give `rate.overrides` an optional `{rate,
  active:{from,until}, applies_to:[programs], metal_types}`, or model each as a tiny synthetic
  program.
- **Annex overrides** (April 2026) — `annex_1a/1b/2/3` rates with a guard that
  preserves separate heading-program rates (EU cars under 9903.94.51) `06:1985`, plus the
  annex sub-mechanisms (`zero_metal_content`, `de_minimis_weight`, `motorcycle_parts`,
  `us_origin_metal` aggregate-share scalings, `06:2003-2092`) → `adjustment_params`.
- **Semiconductor 232 rate blend** — the semi heading rate is
  `heading_232_rate * qualifying_share * (1 − end_use_exemption_share)` (`06:1474`): the
  program scope + 25% default + semi-exclusion precedence are statutory; `qualifying_share`
  (`semi_qualifying_shares.csv`) and `end_use_exemption_share` are `adjustment_params`.
- **`rate_other` catch-all** — `classify_authority()` routes any unmatched footnote-linked
  Ch99 rate to `other` (`rate_schema.R:150`); `rate_other` flows through stacking (additive)
  and the `disable:` vocabulary. The adapter must route it into a generic additive spec.
- **Calculator policy switches** → `adjustment_params` — `ieepa_exempt_scope`
  (`all`/`baseline_only`), `ieepa_duty_free_treatment` (`all`/`nonzero_base_only`, `06:1052`),
  the MFN-exemption `method` (`hs2`), the metal-content `method` (`flat`/`bea`/`cbo`), and the
  global `tpc_additive` stacking mode (`stacking.R:144`) all change baseline output and must be
  pinned (baseline = empty scenario must hold their current values).
- **Auto rebate / US-content shares**, **subdivision-r blends**, **de-minimis** →
  `adjustment_params` (modeling assumptions, not statute). Note subdivision-(r) is *mixed*: its
  product list, country set (EU/JP/KR), and 15% floor are statutory scope; only `certified_share`
  / `fta_exempt_shares` are adjustment knobs (`06:2136-2198`).
- **Section 201** — a live authority (`rate_section_201`, `06:2387`) with a solar product list
  (`s201_solar_products.csv`) and a hardcoded **Canada exemption**
  (`setdiff(countries, CTY_CANADA)`, `06:2401`) — the same hardcode the draft criticizes for 301.
  Promote to a one-program spec (`country_scope: {include: all, exclude: [Canada]}`,
  `stacking.class: additive`) **and** add it to the `disable:` vocabulary
  (`policy_params.yaml:346`), which omits it today.

### Value-configured vs. structure-configured

The distinction that motivates this whole schema: `cty_china = '5700'` being in
config makes the *value* "China" configurable, but the *fact that 301 applies to
exactly `{China}`* is still a hardcoded branch condition — you cannot re-scope
it without editing code. AuthoritySpec promotes every authority from
**value-configured** to **structure-configured**: the set membership itself
(`country %in% spec$country_scope`) is a config list the engine iterates.

Section 232 is already structure-configured for country scope (it parses exempt
lists and country-specific deals from the Ch99 descriptions). 301 and fentanyl
are only value-configured. **The work is promoting them all to the 232 shape.**

### Section 232 program overlap and precedence

A product can match more than one 232 program, so `programs` needs a first-class
resolution rule — the easy "232 on drones" case is easy only because it overlaps
nothing. Baseline behavior to preserve, and the authoring default:

Resolution is a **precedence pipeline**, not a single `max()`:

- **Rate-independent exclusions first.** Semiconductor articles are stripped from the
  auto/copper/wood/MHD lists *regardless of rate* so only the 25% semi rate applies
  (Note 39(a); `06:1383-1394`); and blanket chapter-level steel/aluminum take precedence
  over heading-program membership (`06:1399`).
- **Then highest-rate-wins** among the remaining heading programs (`06:1434`,
  `max(heading_232_rate)`). This is also the default for authored/scenario programs — but a
  rate *cut* cannot win a `max`, so lowering a 232 rate needs the explicit **replace** op
  (see operations).
- **Equal-rate ties need a rule.** `max()` is silent on which program wins at equal rates;
  specify error-or-listed-order so authored overlaps are deterministic.
- **Annex-override guard** — the annex catch-all must not wipe a product's separate
  heading-program rate (`06:1985`, `heading_program_products`).
- **Metadata is combined, not "taken from the winner."** USMCA exemption is OR-combined
  across overlapping headings — `heading_usmca_exempt = any(...)` (`06:1435`) — not read off
  the single max-rate program. `metal` / `stacking.class` resolve to the *post-exclusion row
  state* in the resolved-program intermediate table (impl req 2), which carries the active
  per-type share, `deriv_type`, `is_copper_heading`, and `s232_annex` — not a pointer to one
  "winning program."

## The scenario delta: operations on specs

A synthetic future revision is a small list of operations over the baseline
specs — the uniform replacement for today's `disable:` / `patches:`
(`config/scenarios.yaml`).

A scenario has **two independent dimensions**: `policy` (statutory deltas over the
specs) and `assumptions` (modeling deltas over `adjustment_params`). Either may be
empty. `baseline_mode` selects current-law (keep scheduled expiries) vs
current-policy (cancel them); `base` pins the branch point.

**Recompute scope differs by dimension.** Only `policy` ops carry `effective_from`, so a
policy-only scenario recomputes forward from that date and reuses baseline before it. An
`assumptions` change (USMCA mode, metal-content method) is **not** dated — it is a
*whole-series* rebuild (it re-runs every revision, the way `build_rebuild_alt_registry`
overrides `pp` today, `09:1342`), so it invalidates the entire series, not just the tip.
Either give assumptions an effective date too, or state this asymmetry explicitly.

```yaml
scenario: drone_232_july2026
description: "232 on drones at 25%, effective 2026-07-31"

policy:
  base: latest                     # or a YYYY-MM-DD pin (effective-date; see "Three borrowings" #2)
  baseline_mode: current_law       # current_law (default) | current_policy
  operations:
    - op: add_program              # the drone case — NEW coverage
      authority: section_232
      effective_from: 2026-07-31
      program:
        id: drones
        product_scope: { prefixes: ['8806'] }
        country_scope: { include: all }
        rate: { default: 0.25 }
        stacking: { class: primary_full }  # 232 owns FULL customs value, IEEPA excluded;
                                           # no metal content (primary_metal would be invalid here)
        usmca_treatment: none

    - op: set_country_scope        # the re-scoping case
      authority: section_301
      program: s301
      country_scope: { include: ['5700','5520'] }   # China + Vietnam (5520)
      effective_from: 2026-07-31

    - op: set_rate                 # the simple rate-bump case
      authority: ieepa_reciprocal
      country: '5520'              # Vietnam
      rate: 0.46
      effective_from: 2026-07-31

assumptions: {}                    # e.g. usmca_utilization, auto_content_share overrides
```

**Operation verbs:** `add_program`, `disable` (authority or program), `set_rate` /
`replace_rate` / `add_rate` / `target_total`, `set_country_scope`, `set_product_scope`
(full replace; or `add_products` / `remove_products`), `set_active`, and `set_field` (a
guarded setter for `stacking.class` / `stacking.exceptions` / `metal` / `usmca_treatment`
of an existing program). Each carries `effective_from`.

**Resolution rules** (must be specified, not implied):
- Operations apply **in listed order**; for the *same target and same date*, later ops win.
  But each op's `effective_from` sets the interval its change takes effect from, so two ops
  on one target at *different* dates produce a **multi-interval timeline**, not last-wins.
- **`set_rate` destination is authority-shape-aware:** for `by_country` authorities (IEEPA
  recip/fentanyl) `set_rate ... country:` writes `rate.by_country[country]`; for `overrides`
  authorities (232 deals, UK) it writes `rate.overrides[country]`. `set_rate` *without*
  `country:` on a `by_country` authority is a **hard error** (require `country:`). `add_rate`
  adjusts; `target_total` sets the all-in floor (writes `rate.target_total`); `replace_rate` overwrites the resolved
  program rate **bypassing highest-rate-wins** (the rate-cut path, decision 8). These write
  orthogonal fields and do not silently cross-write each other.
- **`add_program` with an existing program id is a hard error** (consistent with "never a
  silent no-op"); modify an existing program through the targeted setters above instead.
- `authority` may name an **authority-group alias** (`ieepa` → reciprocal + fentanyl) so one
  op hits both without manual sync. **Country-group aliases** (`eu27`, `swiss`) are a separate
  namespace, valid only in `country_scope` and per-country rate keys (`by_country` /
  `target_total`).
- Unknown authority/program id, unknown census code, or `primary_metal` without a
  `metal.type` → **hard error**, never a silent no-op.

**The timeline splitter is new work, not a reuse of `collect_patch_split_dates()`**
(`apply_scenarios.R:292`, which only reads `patches[].filter.from_date`). A synthetic
revision must build a modified spec set, recompute coverage, assign a synthetic
revision id, and append the forward interval(s) — which the current
`09_daily_series.R` interval-splitting does **not** do.

## Three borrowings from tariff-etrs

ETRs independently arrived at the same scenario shape (a dated timeline + a
delta off a base), which validates this model. Three things from its design are
worth adopting:

1. **Explicit dated-timeline framing.** An ETRs scenario is an ordered list of
   effective-dated states, so one scenario can express *sequential* changes
   (e.g. "S122 expires July 24, *then* pharma 232 layers on Sept 29"). Our
   `operations[].effective_from` already supports this; adopt the framing — a
   scenario *is* a mini revision-timeline appended to the baseline.

2. **A pinnable base, not just `latest`.** ETRs' `historical: '2026-02-24'`
   lets a counterfactual delta off a *specific* base rather than always the tip.
   Support both `base: latest` and `base: <date>` — useful for reproducibility
   and "what if we'd done X back in April." **Semantics of a past pin (effective-date
   cut):** the pipeline records only *effective* dates, never enactment/announcement dates,
   so "suppress revisions *enacted* after the pin" is not computable. Define the pin on
   effective date instead: load the persisted per-revision spec (impl req 1) at-or-before
   the pin, which by construction keeps every change *already scheduled as of then* (s122
   sunset, Annex III) and excludes revisions whose effective date is later. Deltas layer on
   top; they do not overwrite scheduled changes unless an op explicitly targets one. (The
   unrecoverable edge: a change *announced* before the pin but *effective* after it cannot be
   told apart from one announced after — accept this, or add an enactment-date column to the
   revision data.) `baseline_mode: current_policy` is the canned scenario that cancels the
   **IEEPA/s122 sunsets** (`set_active until: null`); note it does *not* freeze the other
   scheduled changes that still bend the path (annex restructuring `06:1906`, annex_3 sunset
   `06:2096`), which are not expiries. So current-law and current-policy share one engine —
   current-law is the empty scenario, current-policy is a standard named one.

3. **The statutory / adjustment-parameter boundary.** ETRs keeps statutory
   rates (the dense CSV from the tracker) separate from *adjustment* parameters
   (metal-content method, `us_metal_origin_share`, `de_minimis_weight_share`,
   USMCA shares) in `other_params.yaml`, overlaid by simple shallow-merge. Keep
   that boundary: AuthoritySpec owns statutory structure; a separate
   `adjustment_params` object owns ETR adjustment knobs. Coarse shallow-merge is
   fine for scalar knobs — reserve the richer operation vocabulary for statutory
   structure. **Caveat:** shallow-merge is adequate only for *true scalars*. Several
   "adjustment" knobs are not scalar — `usmca_shares` is a `(mode, year, month)` selector
   that resolves to monthly-file aggregation (`data_loaders.R:109-260`), and `auto_rebate`
   is a fail-closed block of three required keys (`06:1660`) — so `adjustment_params` needs
   its own field reference and merge rules (see below), not just a scalar overlay.

### Why this is complementary to ETRs, not redundant

ETRs has *already migrated off* structured statutory config onto the tracker's
dense `statutory_rates.csv.gz`; its structured per-authority YAMLs
(`config/archive/*/s232.yaml`, `ieepa_reciprocal.yaml`) are legacy, and are
essentially a subset of `AuthoritySpec`. Because ETRs now holds *flat* rates, its
reforms can only tweak adjustment parameters — it **cannot** add coverage or
re-scope an authority. ETRs' architecture already assumes statutory deltas come
from upstream. `AuthoritySpec` is exactly that missing upstream half.

| | Tracker (`AuthoritySpec`) | ETRs (reform overlays) |
|---|---|---|
| Owns | statutory structure: scope, rates, coverage, stacking | adjustment params: metal content, exemption shares, USMCA |
| "232 on drones" / "301 → Vietnam"? | ✅ structured scope, upstream | ❌ flat rates, downstream |

### The `adjustment_params` dimension (field reference)

`adjustment_params` is a real contract, not a bag of scalars — enumerate it the way the
spec enumerates statutory fields:

| Knob | Shape | Where it lives today |
|---|---|---|
| `usmca_shares` | `(mode, year, month)` selector → resolves to a file / monthly aggregation at calc time; modes `none` / `annual` / `monthly` / `fixed_month` / `hybrid_rolling` | `data_loaders.R:109-260`; `06:2536-2646` |
| `auto_rebate` | **fail-closed** block `{rebate_rate, us_assembly_share, us_auto_content_share}` (missing key → error) | `06:1660-1672` |
| `metal_content` | `method` ∈ `flat`/`bea`/`cbo` + per-type share file (`bea` enables steel/aluminum/copper/other shares) | `06:471-508`, `metal_content_shares_bea_hs10.csv` |
| `subdivision_r` | `certified_share` + `fta_exempt_shares` — **only the shares**; the product list, EU/JP/KR set, and 15% floor are statutory | `06:2136-2198` |
| `mfn_exemption` | `method` ∈ `hs2`/off + HS2×country share file → reduces `base_rate` | `06:842`, `06:2456-2474` |
| `ieepa_exempt_scope` / `ieepa_duty_free_treatment` | enum switches that change which products get reciprocal | `06:773/782/1052` |
| `tpc_additive` | global stacking mode (all authorities additive; sensitivity) | `stacking.R:144` |
| `de_minimis` | weight-share knob | (assumptions) |

Merge rule: scalar knobs shallow-merge; the file-/mode-backed knobs (`usmca_shares`,
`metal_content`, `mfn_exemption`) resolve through their loader and must be **pinned in the
persisted per-revision state** so a `base:<date>` reload reproduces them.

**Cross-dimension coupling (not fully independent).** `add_program` for a 232 auto/MHD type
will *not* receive `us_auto_content_share` / rebate scaling, because that math keys off
membership in the baseline-derived `auto_products` / `mhd_products` sets (`06:2606`), not the
spec. So the resolved-program intermediate table (impl req 2) must carry the program's
`metal` / `usmca_treatment` / `stacking.class`, and adjustment scaling must key off *that*,
not the legacy derived sets — otherwise new statutory coverage silently misses its assumptions.

## Data flow under the new model

```
JSON archives ──parse(03/04/05)──▶ [AuthoritySpec × authorities]  ◀── baseline = specs as-is
                                            │                          scenario = specs + operations
                                            ▼
                  calculate_rates_for_revision(specs, products, countries)
                                            │   (one apply path; stacking.class picks the math)
                                            ▼
                                       rate panel ──▶ stacking ──▶ daily / ETR
```

`calculate_rates_for_revision()` stops taking `ieepa_rates`, `s232_rates`,
`fentanyl_rates` as separate ad-hoc args and takes **one list of
`AuthoritySpec`**. The parsers' job becomes "normalize JSON into specs." The
scenario layer's job becomes "apply operations to specs." Both hand the
calculator the identical shape.

## Implementation requirements surfaced in review

Three things the schema implies but the current code does not yet support:

1. **Per-revision spec persistence (for `base: <date>`).** `policy_params.yaml` is
   *current-only* — it is not versioned as "what we knew on 2026-02-24" (IEEPA
   invalidation date, s122 expiry, Swiss/Annex settings, horizon all live in the
   single current file). A past pin would otherwise leak *today's* future knowledge
   into a historical baseline. Requirement: each baseline revision **saves its
   normalized `AuthoritySpec` + `adjustment_params`**; a pinned `base:` loads the
   saved state at-or-before the pin (on **effective date**, per decision 6); a scheduled
   future event continues only if it was already encoded in that saved state. The persisted
   artifact must hold the **resolved, date-fixed** `policy_params` slice (IEEPA invalidation
   date, s122/Swiss windows, annex settings, horizon) — not a pointer to the current file —
   and record `use_policy_dates`, since `policy_effective_date` silently overrides
   `effective_date` under the default build (`revisions.R:119`), so a pinned reload must
   reproduce the same date axis. (Retroactive corrections — rev_5/6/7 "retroactive to April
   6" — mean the spec must also record whether it captured the as-published or as-corrected
   JSON.) Without this, "past base" is reproducible only by `git checkout`, not by scenario
   config.

2. **A resolved-program intermediate table (before collapsing to `rate_*`).** The
   output panel collapses 232 down to `rate_232` + `metal_share`, which is *not enough*
   for a generic stacker: two rows can both have `rate_232 > 0` yet need different stacking
   (steel owns only the metal-content fraction; autos/drones own full customs value;
   semis/annex have special overlap rules). The stacker cannot infer this from `rate_232`
   alone. Build an intermediate table at resolution time. The minimal
   `(hts10, country, authority, program_id, rate, stacking_class, metal_type,
   usmca_treatment)` set is **insufficient** — it must also carry `base_rate` (every floor
   subtracts it), `nonmetal_share` (computed *per metal type*, `stacking.R:79-99` — or the
   per-type `steel/aluminum/copper/other_metal_share` + `deriv_type` + `is_copper_heading`),
   `s232_annex`, and a within-authority phase/precedence rank for IEEPA. Collapse to the
   `rate_*` columns *after* stacking. This is what makes the `stacking.class` generalization
   (step 3) actually reliable.

   **Define the output contract.** Earlier sections promise the RATE_SCHEMA panel is
   *preserved*, while this collapses to `rate_*` only after stacking — resolve the tension by
   stating which artifact each consumer reads. Today `09` re-derives net authority
   contributions from the snapshot's `rate_*` columns **plus preserved extras** (`09:220`,
   `compute_net_authority_contributions`). Decide whether the program table is internal-only,
   persisted as snapshot *extras* (formalizing today's per-type-share extras), or *replaces*
   that downstream decomposition — and say which.

3. **A unified timeline splitter.** The synthetic-revision builder must collect **all**
   schedule boundaries into one splitter — `active.from` / `active.until`, scenario
   `effective_from`, the horizon, and **every `effective_date`-keyed gate**, not just the two
   post-panel expiries (s122/Swiss) in `collect_expiry_adjustments`. The calculator-internal
   gates are easy to miss because they are not "expiries": annex activation (`06:1906`),
   annex_3 sunset (`06:2096`), IEEPA invalidation (`06:754`), and Ch99 `effective_date_offset`
   activations (`filter_active_ch99`). Today these reach the timeline through two separate
   mechanisms (`filter_active_ch99` + `get_expiry_split_points`) that do **not** cover
   mid-interval Ch99 activations; the unified splitter replaces both.

## Migration plan (incremental, not a rewrite)

Each step is independently shippable and leaves the panel output **within numeric
tolerance** (refactors reorder float ops, so byte-identity is the wrong bar).

0. **Parity harness first — build it, don't "extend."** Neither a baseline golden, a
   per-authority golden, nor a tolerance comparator exists today, and
   `scripts/submit_alt_equivalence.sh` is byte-level `cmp` over a **hardcoded** variant list
   that has already drifted (6 listed vs 7 in `build_rebuild_alt_registry`, `09:1342`). So:
   author a tolerance comparator (specify ε **per column class** — rates vs shares vs
   weighted ETR — absolute or relative, plus near-zero handling), capture a **baseline +
   per-authority golden** from a clean build, and **drive the variant list from
   `build_rebuild_alt_registry`** so it cannot drift again. This is the safety net the rest
   of the plan leans on.

   The migration also has real **API blast radius**: replacing `ieepa_rates` /
   `s232_rates` / `fentanyl_rates` with one spec list touches both build paths
   (`00_build_timeseries.R:254`, `09_daily_series.R`). Make the **adapter + signature change**
   its own parity-gated step (between 0 and 1), with a transitional path that accepts both the
   old args and a new `specs` arg, before any generic loop.

1. **Normalize the inputs — in two commits.** *(1a)* Introduce the adapter and re-plumb the
   calc to read fields off the spec *while still re-extracting internally* — a pure shape
   change, easiest to prove parity, no behavior moves. *(1b, separately)* Make the spec
   **authoritative**: today `calculate_rates_for_revision()` always re-derives `s232_rates`
   from the date-gated `ch99_data` (`06:724-726`, `06:1276-1278`), discarding the passed-in
   argument, **and** `calculate_rates_fast()` seeds *all seven* authority columns directly
   from Ch99 footnote refs (`classify_authority` → pivot, `06:50-230`) before the authority
   blocks run. Both the re-extraction *and* the footnote-seeding path must be gated/converted
   so a synthetic spec actually drives the panel's first write — a behavior-bearing move,
   parity-gated, not a no-op. Then move program activation into the structure (`active.from`)
   instead of the raw-Ch99 grep at `06:1313`. **Note:** IEEPA invalidation is today a
   whole-revision kill switch at two sites (`06:754`, `06:1266`) plus a grid densification;
   mapping it to per-authority `active.until` needs an explicit parity case and lockstep
   conversion of both sites. (These steps preserve the calculator's internal step sequence —
   the multi-step calc, ~15 numbered steps per the file header — only the *inputs* change.)

2. **Un-hardcode scope** for 301 / fentanyl. The authoritative coverage gate — the one that
   decides whether a 301 rate exists at all — is in the calculator, **not** `stacking.R`:
   `06:2275-2304` scopes `rate_301` to China (`if_else(country == CTY_CHINA, pmax(rate_301,
   blanket_301), rate_301)`, and forces new rows to `CTY_CHINA`). Replace it with
   `country %in% spec$country_scope` there **first**, then also un-hardcode the downstream
   `country == cty_china` branches in `src/stacking.R` (`apply_stacking_rules` `:161/166`,
   `compute_net_authority_contributions` net_301 `:239`). Editing only `stacking.R` would
   leave 301 scoped to China and still pass a byte-identical baseline — a silent miss.
   Small, high-value, unlocks re-scoping scenarios.

3. **Build the resolved-program intermediate table, then generalize stacking.** First land
   impl req 2 (the intermediate table) and prove the collapse-after-stacking reproduces
   today's `rate_*` within tolerance — the doc calls this "what makes the `stacking.class`
   generalization reliable," so it is a gated sub-step, not an implied one. Then generalize
   stacking to read `stacking.class` + `stacking.exceptions` instead of literal branches —
   this is where the China-fentanyl special case becomes data.

4. **Collapse steps opportunistically.** Once authorities are uniform specs, the
   per-authority step blocks can merge into a generic "apply each spec" loop.
   Optional polish, not a prerequisite.

USMCA is the one authority left as-is: its `{Canada, Mexico}` scope is
definitional, not a policy choice.

### End-state (future, not part of the initial migration)

Once steps 1–4 hold parity and per-revision spec persistence is in place, the
**adapter and the bespoke `param-object-1` structs can be removed entirely**: the
parser emits `AuthoritySpec` directly ("normalize JSON into specs"). This is a *fold*,
not a deletion — the extraction logic moves into the parser rather than disappearing,
so the performance win is modest (the saved cost is the reshape, not the parsing). The
real wins are a single source of truth and removing the redundant re-extraction that
`00_build_timeseries.R:233`, `09_daily_series.R:1156`, and `06` (internally) each do
independently today. Why it is a *later* step, not the first one:

- It must follow parity lock-in — emitting specs directly changes parsing, shape, and
  the calculator interface at once, which is unbisectable if parity breaks.
- All five build/read sites (`00`, `09`, `06`, `generate_etrs_config.R`) must migrate
  together, consolidating the three independent pre-extractions into one. **This is not a
  pure fold:** the sites diverge today — `generate_etrs_config.R:229` extracts 232 from
  *unfiltered* `ch99` and its heading-gate list lacks the `semiconductors` entry that
  `06:1325` has — so reconcile (or fix) those before consolidating, and add the ETR-config
  output to the parity gate.
- The spec is assembled from JSON **plus** `policy_params.yaml`, so "parser emits spec"
  is really "parser + config-merge emits spec"; some `param-object-1` fields (`has_232`,
  `auto_has_deals`) are gating scratch and need triage, not a 1:1 copy.
- It composes with per-revision persistence: the persisted spec then becomes the
  canonical per-revision artifact, and `param-object-1` has no remaining consumer.

## Open questions

- **Rate representation for product-tiered authorities** (301 at 7.5% / 25%):
  carried by the `list_file` (`by_product_tier`), or split into multiple
  programs? The list-file approach matches the current `s301_product_lists.csv`.
  Note `add_program` for a file-backed authority has no inline tier path today —
  adding *new* 301 product coverage in a scenario needs a file or an inline tier list.
- **Effective dates beyond the horizon**: scenarios effective in 2027 require
  extending `series_horizon` (currently `2026-12-31`). This also interacts with weighting —
  import weights are fixed at 2024 Census flows, so far-forward intervals carry stale weights;
  decide whether 2027 scenarios error, clamp, or re-weight.

**Deferred — operational lifecycle** (out of scope for this revision; recorded so they are
not lost):

- **New-coverage weight provisioning.** `add_program` over genuinely new products only moves
  revenue if those `hts10 × country` pairs exist in the 2024 Census import weights — the ETR
  weighting `inner_join`s on them (`08:389`), so thin/absent flows are silently zero-weighted.
  The drone (`8806`) flagship example needs this checked.
- **Scenario-correctness validation.** Parity (step 0) covers baseline only. There is no
  golden/fixture for a counterfactual, no "this op changed exactly these rows and nothing
  else" assertion, no regression harness for the verb vocabulary.
- **Backward-compatibility** with the existing `disable:` / `patches:` format — 8 live
  scenarios in `config/scenarios.yaml` + `docs/scenarios.md` +
  `run_post_build_scenarios_per_revision`. Translate, dual-support, or hard-cut?
- **Multi-scenario composition.** How the `policy × assumptions × baseline_mode × base`
  cross-product is enumerated, named, and written to `output/alternative/<variant>.csv`.
- **Results / reporting.** A policy user needs the revenue/ETR-delta decomposition, not a raw
  `hts10 × country` rate diff — specify the scenario output.
- **Recompute cost.** A synthetic revision recomputed forward is not free; the existing alt
  rebuilds budget ~85 min / 192 GB per batch (`submit_alt_equivalence.sh`). Bound it.
- **Scenario-file versioning** (`schema_version`) and migration of old scenario files as the
  verb vocabulary evolves.
- **Authoring UX.** A `--validate-scenario` dry-run (resolve scopes/codes/programs, report
  what *would* change before a multi-hour recompute) and a YAML schema for editor validation;
  a successor to `docs/scenarios.md`.

  `snapshot_<rev>.rds`, `delta_*.rds`, `compare_scenarios`, and the changelog all key on it.

_Resolved during review:_ `adjustment_params` is a **separate scenario dimension**
(decision 3), not folded into the spec. Identifiers are **Census codes** (decision 5).
Parity is **numeric tolerance** (decision 4). Baseline is **current-law by default**
with current-policy as a canned scenario (decision 6).
